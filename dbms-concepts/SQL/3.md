# **SQLBolt Lesson 3: Queries with Constraints (Pt. 2)**

---

## **1. Introduction**

* When working with **text (string) columns**, SQL provides special operators for comparisons and pattern matching.
* Useful for **filtering rows based on string data**, including case-sensitive, case-insensitive, and wildcard matching.

---

## **2. Operators for Text Data**

| Operator       | Meaning                                                               | Example                                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`            | Case-sensitive exact match                                            | `col_name = "abc"`                                   |
| `!=` or `<>`   | Case-sensitive inequality                                             | `col_name != "abcd"`                                 |
| `LIKE`         | Case-insensitive match                                                | `col_name LIKE "ABC"`                                |
| `NOT LIKE`     | Case-insensitive mismatch                                             | `col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"`                           |
| `%`            | Wildcard: matches zero or more characters (used with LIKE/NOT LIKE)   | `col_name LIKE "%AT%"` (matches "AT", "CAT", "BATS") |
| `_`            | Wildcard: matches exactly **one** character (used with LIKE/NOT LIKE) | `col_name LIKE "AN_"` (matches "AND", but not "AN")  |
| `IN (...)`     | Value exists in a list                                                | `col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")`                        |
| `NOT IN (...)` | Value does **not** exist in a list                                    | `col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")`                    |

> **Note:** All string values **must be quoted** (single or double quotes) so SQL can distinguish them from keywords.

## **4. Example Queries**

| Task                                              | SQL Query                                                               | Explanation                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Find all **Toy Story movies**                     | `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE "Toy Story%";`                   | `%` matches any characters after "Toy Story" |
| Find all movies **directed by John Lasseter**     | `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE director = "John Lasseter";`                | Exact string match on director column        |
| Find all movies **not directed by John Lasseter** | `SELECT title, director FROM movies WHERE director != "John Lasseter";` | Filters out all movies by John Lasseter      |
| Find all **WALL-* movies**                        | `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE "WALL-%";`                       | `%` matches anything after "WALL-"           |

## **5. Key Notes**

* String comparison can be **case-sensitive** depending on the DBMS.
* Use `LIKE` and wildcards `%` or `_` for **pattern matching**.
* `IN` and `NOT IN` are useful for checking against a **list of strings**.
* For **large-scale text search**, consider **full-text search libraries** like Apache Lucene or Sphinx.

✅ These notes now cover **Lesson 3** clearly.

I can continue to **Lesson 4: Filtering and Sorting Query Results** next so your SQLBolt notes remain fully organized.

Do you want me to do that now?
