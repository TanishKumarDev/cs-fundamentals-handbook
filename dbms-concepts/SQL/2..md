Perfect! Let’s organize **SQLBolt Lesson 2: Queries with Constraints (Pt. 1)** in a structured way:

---

# **SQLBolt Lesson 2: Queries with Constraints (Pt. 1)**

---

## **1. Introduction**

* Selecting all rows from a table with millions of records is **inefficient**.
* To **filter results**, we use the **WHERE clause**.
* The WHERE clause checks conditions for **each row** to determine whether it should be included in the results.

---

## **2. Syntax: SELECT with Constraints**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR ...;
```

* Use **AND** / **OR** to combine multiple conditions.
* Each condition is evaluated for every row, and only rows that satisfy the conditions are returned.

## **3. Useful Operators**

| Operator                  | Meaning                                                            | Example                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `=`                       | Equal to                                                           | `col_name = 5`                  |
| `!=`                      | Not equal to                                                       | `col_name != 4`                 |
| `<, <=, >, >=`            | Less than, Less than or equal, Greater than, Greater than or equal | `col_name >= 10`                |
| `BETWEEN ... AND ...`     | Number within a range (inclusive)                                  | `col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5` |
| `NOT BETWEEN ... AND ...` | Number not within a range                                          | `col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10` |
| `IN (...)`                | Value exists in a list                                             | `col_name IN (2, 4, 6)`         |
| `NOT IN (...)`            | Value does not exist in a list                                     | `col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)`     |

> **Tip:** Constraining rows improves query performance and makes results easier to read.

## **4. Example Table: Movies**

| title          | year |
| -------------- | ---- |
| Toy Story      | 1995 |
| A Bug's Life   | 1998 |
| Toy Story 2    | 1999 |
| Monsters, Inc. | 2001 |
| Finding Nemo   | 2003 |

## **5. Example Queries Using Constraints**

| Task                                          | SQL Query                                                    | Explanation                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Find the **movie with row id = 6**            | `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE id = 6;`                         | Returns the movie whose id is 6                   |
| Movies **released between 2000 and 2010**     | `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;`     | Returns movies released in the range 2000–2010    |
| Movies **not released between 2000 and 2010** | `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year NOT BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;` | Returns movies outside the 2000–2010 range        |
| First 5 Pixar movies and their release year   | `SELECT title, year FROM movies LIMIT 5;`                    | Returns only the first 5 rows with title and year |

---

## **6. Key Notes**

* SQL keywords are **case-insensitive**, but conventionally capitalized.
* Multiple conditions can be combined using **AND** or **OR**.
* Using **WHERE** filters rows, reducing the amount of data returned and improving performance.

✅ These are the **organized notes for Lesson 2**.

I can continue and **organize Lesson 3 (Queries with Constraints Pt. 2)** next, so your SQLBolt notes remain consistent and ready for quick reference.

Do you want me to do that now?
