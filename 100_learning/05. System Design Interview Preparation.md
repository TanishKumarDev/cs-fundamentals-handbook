# Day 5/100 - System Design Interview Preparation

## Overview / Introduction
System design interviews assess your ability to translate ambiguous problems into concrete technical requirements, create architectures that satisfy those requirements, and articulate design decisions effectively. These interviews are crucial for senior engineering positions and require specific preparation strategies.

#### 1. Load Balancing
- Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers
- Ensures reliability and high availability
- Prevents any single server from becoming overloaded

#### 2. Caching
- Stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval
- Reduces database load and improves response times
- Common implementations: Redis, Memcached

#### 3. Database Sharding
- Horizontally partitions databases to handle large-scale data growth
- Distributes data across multiple database instances
- Enables scalability beyond single database limits

#### 4. Replication
- Creates copies of data across multiple database replicas
- Improves availability and fault tolerance
- Enables read scalability and disaster recovery

#### 5. CAP Theorem
- Fundamental trade-off in distributed systems:
  - Consistency: All nodes see same data simultaneously
  - Availability: Every request receives response
  - Partition Tolerance: System operates despite network partitions

#### 6. Consistent Hashing
- Distributes load evenly in dynamic server environments
- Minimizes data movement when adding/removing servers
- Essential for distributed caching and databases

#### 7. Message Queues
- Decouples services using asynchronous communication
- Enables event-driven architecture
- Provides reliability and fault tolerance

#### 8. Rate Limiting
- Controls request frequency to prevent system overload
- Protects against DDoS attacks and API abuse
- Ensures fair resource allocation

#### 9. API Gateway
- Centralized entry point for routing API requests
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- Simplifies client-side service consumption

#### 10. Microservices
- Architectural style that structures applications as loosely coupled services
- Enables independent development and deployment
- Improves scalability and fault isolation

#### 11. Service Discovery
- Automatically detects services in distributed systems
- Essential for dynamic environments with frequent deployments
- Enables load balancing and failover

#### 12. CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- Distributes content to edge servers geographically closer to users
- Reduces latency and improves content delivery speed
- Handles static assets and media files efficiently

#### 13. Database Indexing
- Improves query performance by creating optimized data structures
- Speeds up data retrieval operations
- Requires trade-off between read performance and write overhead

#### 14. Data Partitioning
- Divides data across multiple nodes or databases
- Enables horizontal scaling and improved performance
- Includes range, hash, and list partitioning strategies

#### 15. Eventual Consistency
- Guarantees that all replicas will become consistent over time
- Common in distributed databases and NoSQL systems
- Provides high availability with relaxed consistency

#### 16. WebSockets
- Enables full-duplex, bidirectional communication between clients and servers
- Essential for real-time applications and live updates
- More efficient than polling for frequent data exchanges

#### 17. Scalability
- System's ability to handle increased load by adding resources
- Vertical scaling: Upgrading existing hardware
- Horizontal scaling: Adding more machines to the system

#### 18. Fault Tolerance
- System's ability to continue operating properly in the event of failures
- Includes redundancy, failover mechanisms, and graceful degradation
- Critical for high-availability systems

#### 19. Monitoring
- Continuous tracking of system metrics, logs, and performance indicators
- Essential for understanding system health and diagnosing issues
- Enables proactive maintenance and capacity planning

#### 20. Authentication & Authorization
- Authentication: Verifying user identity
- Authorization: Determining user permissions and access rights
- Critical for security and access control in distributed systems

## Interview Preparation Strategy

### Practice Methodology
- **Hands-on Design**: Practice designing real-world systems from scratch
- **Visual Diagramming**: Use whiteboards and diagramming tools extensively
- **Pattern Recognition**: Study common design patterns and their trade-offs
- **Mock Interviews**: Simulate real interview conditions regularly

### Recommended Study Approach
1. **Start with Real Systems**: Design Instagram, Uber, Twitter from scratch
2. **Identify Core Components**:
   - Frontend clients and application servers
   - Caching layers and database systems
   - Distributed storage and content delivery
3. **Map Key Flows**: User uploads, feed generation, data retrieval
4. **Analyze Trade-offs**: Justify technology choices with specific reasoning
