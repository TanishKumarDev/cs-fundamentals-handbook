Absolutely! Letâ€™s organize **SQLBolt Lesson 1 notes** in a clean and structured way for easy reference:

# **SQLBolt Lesson 1: SELECT Queries 101**

---

## **1. What is a SELECT Query?**

* A **query** is a statement that specifies:

  1. What data you want
  2. Where to find it in the database
  3. Optional transformations before returning it

* Tables can be thought of as **entities**:

  * **Table** = Entity (e.g., Dogs, Movies)
  * **Row** = Instance (e.g., Toy Story, A pug)
  * **Column** = Property/attribute (e.g., title, color, director)

---

## **2. Basic Syntax**

### **Select Specific Columns**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

* Returns a **2D set of rows and columns** with only the specified columns.

### **Select All Columns**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```

* `*` = all columns
* Useful to inspect all table data quickly.

## **4. Example Queries**

| Task                                     | SQL Query                             | Explanation                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Find **title** of each film              | `SELECT title FROM movies;`           | Returns only the title column    |
| Find **director** of each film           | `SELECT director FROM movies;`        | Returns only the director column |
| Find **title and director** of each film | `SELECT title, director FROM movies;` | Returns both title and director  |
| Find **title and year** of each film     | `SELECT title, year FROM movies;`     | Returns title and release year   |
| Find **all information** of each film    | `SELECT * FROM movies;`               | Returns all columns              |

## **5. Key Notes**

* SQL is **not case-sensitive**, but keywords are often capitalized for readability.
* Use **semicolon (`;`)** to terminate queries.
* Columns and tables may be **case-sensitive** depending on the database.
* **Strings** must be in single quotes `' '`.

These notes summarize **all key points from Lesson 1** in an organized, easy-to-use format.

If you want, I can now **organize Lesson 2 (Queries with Constraints) in the same clean way** so both lessons are ready for reference.

Do you want me to do that?
