# **ER Modeling: Complete Guide for any Systems**

* Read this - https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/er-model-in-dbms/


## **1. Understand the System (Requirements Gathering)**

Before drawing anything:

1. **Read the problem carefully**.
2. **Ask questions if unclear**:

   * What entities exist?
   * What relationships exist?
   * Are there optional/mandatory associations?
   * Any special rules or constraints?

**Example:** Banking System

* Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Loans, Branches, Employees

---

## **2. Identify Entities**

* **Entities:** Real-world objects or concepts with **unique identity**.
* Types:

  * **Strong Entity:** Has a primary key, exists independently.
  * **Weak Entity:** Depends on another entity; identified via partial key + owner entity.

**Example:**

* Strong: Customer, Account, Loan, Employee, Branch
* Weak: Transaction (depends on Account)

**Tip:** Ask: “Can this exist alone?” If **no → weak entity**.

---

## **3. Identify Attributes**

* **Attributes:** Describe entities.
* Types:

  * **Simple:** Atomic, indivisible (Name, Age)
  * **Composite:** Made of multiple sub-attributes (FullName → First, Last)
  * **Derived:** Calculated from other attributes (Age from DOB)
  * **Multivalued:** Can have multiple values (PhoneNumbers)

**Primary Key:** Unique identifier for each entity.

---

## **4. Identify Relationships**

* **Relationships** connect entities.

* **Questions to ask:**

  * How many instances of Entity A relate to Entity B?
  * Is participation optional or mandatory?
  * Is there a special constraint?

* **Types of Relationships:**

  * One-to-One (1:1)
  * One-to-Many (1\:N)
  * Many-to-Many (M\:N)

* **Naming:** Use **verb phrases** to describe actions.

  * Examples: “Has”, “BelongsTo”, “Executes”, “ApprovedBy”

## **5. Determine Cardinality & Participation Constraints**

| Concept           | Example          | Interview Tip                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Cardinality**   | 1:1, 1\:N, M\:N  | Draw carefully; most interviewers check this. |
| **Participation** | Total vs Partial | Total → mandatory; Partial → optional         |

* **Example:**

  * Every account must belong to a customer → **Total Participation**
  * Not all employees approve loans → **Partial Participation**

---

## **6. Handle Weak Entities & Identifying Relationships**

* **Weak Entity**: Cannot exist without parent entity.
* **Identifying Relationship:** Connects weak entity to owner.
* Represented by **double rectangle** (weak entity) + **double diamond** (relationship).

**Example:**

* Transaction depends on Account → Transaction is weak entity.

---

## **7. Special ER Concepts**

* **Generalization / Inheritance:**

  * Parent → Child entities
  * Example: Employee → Teller, Manager, LoanOfficer

* **Aggregation:**

  * Treat a relationship as an entity when connecting to other entities
  * Example: “Customer-Account-Transaction” treated as one for “Audit”

* **Multivalued Attributes:**

  * Represented by **double ovals**
  * Example: Customer → multiple phone numbers

---

## **8. Normalize & Avoid Redundancy**

* Keep the design clean:

  * No duplicate information
  * Relationships should reflect real-world logic
* Think ahead to **relational mapping**

---

## **9. Converting ER Diagram to Tables (for Interviews)**

**Rules:**

1. Each **strong entity → table** with attributes + PK
2. Each **weak entity → table** with PK as combination of its partial key + parent PK
3. **1\:N relationship:** FK on “many” side pointing to “one” side
4. **M\:N relationship:** Create **junction table** with composite PK

**Example:**

* Customer → Account (1\:N) → Add CustomerID as FK in Account table
* Customer ↔ Loan (M\:N) → Create CustomerLoan table

---

## **10. Tips for Interview Questions**

1. **Always draw entities first, then relationships.**
2. **Label cardinality clearly** (1:1, 1\:N, M\:N).
3. **Mention participation constraints** (optional/mandatory).
4. **Highlight PK and FK in relational mapping.**
5. **Explain assumptions** if the problem doesn’t specify everything.
6. **Think of scalability & normalization** in large systems.

## **11. Example: Banking System ER Diagram (Simplified)**

```
Customer --< Has >-- Account --< Executes >-- Transaction
     |
     `--< AppliesFor >-- Loan -- ApprovedBy --> Employee
Account -- LocatedAt --> Branch
Employee -- Manages --> Branch
```

* 1\:N → Customer-Account, Account-Transaction
* N:1 → Loan-Employee, Account-Branch
* M\:N → Customer-Loan (if co-owned)

✅ **Key Takeaways for Interviews**

* Always **start from entities → attributes → relationships → constraints**
* Always **mention assumptions**
* **Explain weak entities and special relationships**
* Be ready to **map ER → Relational Tables**
* Large systems are **broken into submodules** for easier ER design
