|----------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Bit** | 1 bit = 0 or 1 | Smallest unit of data—a binary digit. |
| **Byte** | 1 Byte = 8 bits | Standard unit for storing one character (e.g., 'A'). |
| **Kilobyte (KB)** | 1 KB = 1024 Bytes | Size of a small text file. |
| **Megabyte (MB)** | 1 MB = 1024 KB | Size of a photo or short audio file. |
| **Gigabyte (GB)** | 1 GB = 1024 MB | Common for RAM or large files. |
| **Terabyte (TB)** | 1 TB = 1024 GB | Typical for modern hard drives. |
| **Petabyte (PB)** | 1 PB = 1024 TB | Scale for data centers. |

#### Additional Terms
| **Term** | **Meaning** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Nibble** | 4 bits (half a byte). |
| **Word** | CPU-specific size, often 2, 4, or 8 bytes (varies by architecture). |
| **Bit Rate** | Bits processed per second (e.g., in networking or media). |
| **Address** | Numeric identifier for a memory location in RAM. |

**Summary**:
- **Bit**: Basic 0/1 unit.

### 2. RAM vs. ROM: Core Memory Types

RAM and ROM are essential memory types with distinct roles in a computer system.

| **Feature** | **RAM (Random Access Memory)** | **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Type** | Volatile (data lost on power off) | Non-volatile (data retained without power) |
| **Purpose** | Temporary storage for active programs and data | Permanent storage for firmware and boot code |
| **Read/Write** | Read and write allowed | Mostly read-only (some types programmable) |
| **Speed** | Fast access | Slower than RAM |
| **Usage Examples** | Running OS, applications | BIOS, firmware, embedded code |
| **Size** | Larger (e.g., GBs) | Smaller (e.g., MBs or KBs) |
| **Cost** | More expensive per bit | Cheaper per bit |
| **Types** | DRAM, SRAM | PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash |

**Summary**:
- **RAM**: Fast, temporary workspace for ongoing tasks.
- **ROM**: Permanent, unchanging storage for essential system instructions.

### 3. 32-Bit vs. 64-Bit Architecture

This refers to the CPU's register width, affecting data processing and memory addressing.

#### What Does It Mean?
- **32-Bit**: Processes 32 bits (4 bytes) per cycle; max RAM ~4 GB (2³² addresses).
- **64-Bit**: Processes 64 bits (8 bytes) per cycle; max RAM ~18 exabytes (2⁶⁴ addresses).
- Larger bit width enables more efficient processing and vast memory support.

#### Why Powers of 2 (e.g., 2³² and 2⁶⁴)?
- Binary system: Each bit has 2 states (0/1), so n bits yield 2ⁿ values.
- Addresses range from 0 to 2ⁿ - 1 (starting at 0).
- Hardware optimizes for multiples of 8 bits (bytes), making 32/64-bit natural.

#### Why Not Intermediate Sizes (e.g., 40-Bit)?
- **Convention**: Powers of 2 align with hardware design, memory buses, and instruction sets.
- **Compatibility**: 64-bit doubles 32-bit for seamless backward compatibility.
- **Efficiency**: Non-standard sizes increase complexity and cost without proportional benefits.

#### Key Differences
| **Feature** | **32-Bit OS** | **64-Bit OS** |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Max RAM** | ~4 GB (2³² addresses) | ~18 exabytes (2⁶⁴ addresses) |
| **Performance** | Slower (32 bits/cycle) | Faster (64 bits/cycle) |
| **Compatibility** | Only 32-bit apps | Both 32-bit and 64-bit apps |
| **Graphics** | Limited | Better for gaming/3D |

#### Why 64-Bit Is Superior
- **Memory**: Handles >4 GB RAM for modern apps.
- **Performance**: Processes larger data chunks (e.g., 64-bit addition in 1 cycle vs. 2).
- **Future-Proof**: Optimized for contemporary software.
- **Security**: Enhanced features like address randomization.

#### How to Check Your System
- **Windows**: Win + Pause/Break → "System type".
- **Linux**: `lscpu` → Check "CPU op-mode(s)".

#### Interview Questions
1. **Can 32-bit OS use >4 GB RAM?** No, due to addressing limits.
2. **Is 64-bit always faster?** Yes for 64-bit apps; no difference for 32-bit.
3. **Why can't 64-bit OS run on 32-bit CPU?** CPU lacks 64-bit registers.

**Summary**:
- **32-Bit**: Legacy, limited RAM, slower.
- **64-Bit**: Modern, massive RAM, faster, compatible.

### 4. Memory Hierarchy

Memory is organized by speed, cost, and volatility, from fastest (smallest) to slowest (largest).

#### Primary Memory (Volatile)
Lost on power off; used for active processing.

- **Registers**:
  - **Location**: Inside CPU.
  - **Size**: 32/64 bits.

### Addressing Doubts: 32-Bit vs. 64-Bit Architecture

#### Doubt 1: Why Is 64-Bit Needed?
- **Memory Limits**: 32-bit caps at ~4 GB; modern apps (e.g., games, AI) need more.
- **Performance**: Processes 64 bits/cycle vs. 32, speeding operations.
- **Data Handling**: Supports >4 GB files/databases.
- **Future-Proof**: Optimized for current software; backward compatible.
- **Security**: Better malware resistance.
- **Multitasking**: Handles large RAM for simultaneous apps.
- **Example**: 8 GB RAM on 32-bit uses only ~3.5 GB; 64-bit uses all.

#### Doubt 2: Why Jump from 32-Bit to 64-Bit? Why Not Intermediate (e.g., 40-Bit or 48-Bit)?
- **Power of 2**: Aligns with binary/hardware efficiency.
- **Compatibility**: Doubles 32-bit for seamless transitions.
- **Future-Proof**: 64-bit (18 exabytes) exceeds needs; 48-bit (256 TB) would limit sooner.
- **Efficiency**: Standard sizes reduce complexity/cost.
- **History**: Logical progression from 16-bit to 32-bit.
- **Non-Standard Issues**: Intermediate sizes complicate designs without benefits.
- **Example**: x86-64 became industry standard; intermediates lacked support.
