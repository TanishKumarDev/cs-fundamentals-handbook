# **Day 1 – Introduction to DBMS**

## **Article 2: Introduction of DBMS**


### **1. Overview**

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a **software system** designed to **store, manage, and retrieve data** efficiently in a structured manner.
It ensures **data integrity, consistency, and security** across multiple users and applications.
Key capabilities include:

* Reducing data redundancy and inconsistency
* Supporting concurrent data access
* Managing transactions and backups automatically
* Acting as a bridge between users/applications and the central database via APIs

### **2. Problems with Traditional File-Based Systems**

Before DBMS, data was managed using **file systems**, which led to several issues:

| Problem                | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Redundancy**    | Duplicate data stored across multiple files     |
| **Data Inconsistency** | Conflicting or outdated data in different files |
| **Difficult Access**   | Manual searching, no structured queries         |
| **Poor Security**      | No access control or data privacy               |
| **Single-User Access** | No multi-user support or collaboration          |
| **No Backup/Recovery** | Data loss often permanent                       |

**Example:**
A university system storing separate files for academics, results, and hostels often faced these issues.

### **3. Components of a DBMS Application**

DBMS applications consist of **six main components** that work together for efficient data handling:

1. **Hardware**

   * Physical devices: servers, disks, I/O devices.
   * Stores and processes data.
   * Examples: HDDs, RAM, network devices.

2. **Software**

   * DBMS software (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL).
   * Includes the **database engine**, **OS**, **network tools**, and **utilities**.
   * Translates user/database queries into operations.

3. **Data**

   * **Operational data**: actual user data (name, age, etc.).
   * **Metadata**: data about data (type, size, storage info).
   * Core of DBMS — stored in structured form.

4. **Procedures**

   * Guidelines for using the DBMS securely and effectively.
   * Covers login, access control, validation, backups, and reporting.

5. **Database Access Language**

   * Used to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD).
   * Examples: **SQL, PL/SQL, MyAccess**.
   * Types:

     * **DDL (Data Definition Language)** – `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
     * **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

6. **People**

   * **Database Administrators (DBA):** Manage performance, security, and users.
   * **Developers:** Build applications using the DBMS.
   * **End Users:** Access data through apps (e.g., students, employees).

### **4. Types of DBMS**

| Type                              | Description                                                                  | Examples                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**       | Data stored in tables (rows & columns). Supports relationships via keys.     | MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server                  |
| **NoSQL DBMS**                    | Non-relational; supports flexible data models (key-value, document, graph).  | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis                  |
| **Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)** | Stores data as objects with methods and properties; integrates OOP concepts. | ObjectDB, db4o                             |
| **Hierarchical DBMS**             | Tree-like structure (parent-child). Efficient but rigid.                     | IBM IMS                                    |
| **Network DBMS**                  | Graph-like structure; supports many-to-many relationships.                   | IDS, TurboIMAGE                            |
| **Cloud-Based DBMS**              | Hosted on cloud platforms, scalable, with automated backups.                 | Amazon RDS, MongoDB Atlas, Google BigQuery |

### **5. Database Languages**

A DBMS uses different **languages** for defining, manipulating, and controlling data:

| Language                               | Purpose                        | Key Commands                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **DDL (Data Definition Language)**     | Defines database schema        | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`           |
| **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**   | Manages data (CRUD operations) | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE` |
| **DCL (Data Control Language)**        | Manages user permissions       | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                               |
| **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** | Controls transactions          | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`               |
| **DQL (Data Query Language)**          | Retrieves data from database   | `SELECT`                                        |

### **6. Applications of DBMS**

| Domain           | Use                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Banking**      | Manage accounts, transactions, and customer info |
| **E-commerce**   | Track inventory, orders, and customers           |
| **Healthcare**   | Store patient data and diagnoses                 |
| **Education**    | Manage student info, attendance, and results     |
| **Social Media** | Handle user profiles, interactions, and feeds    |
| **Data Science** | Enable large-scale data analysis and prediction  |

### **7. Summary**

* DBMS is **core software** for structured data management, ensuring **security, consistency, and efficiency**.
* It overcomes traditional file system problems through **centralization**, **concurrency control**, and **data abstraction**.
* Different types (RDBMS, NoSQL, etc.) serve varied needs, while **database languages** provide control over structure, manipulation, and security.
