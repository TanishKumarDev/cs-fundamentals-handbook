# **Day 4 – Databases: Languages, Roles, and Privileges**

## **Article 2: Roles and Privileges**

### **1. Overview**

In DBMS, **security** ensures data is **confidential, accurate, and accessible only to authorized users**.
Authorization is the process of granting users permission to access database objects in a controlled manner.

* **Privilege** – The allowed operations a user can perform on data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
* **Role** – A collection of privileges that can be assigned to users for easier management.

### **2. Authorization**

Authorization ensures only eligible users can perform allowed operations.

Types of access:

| Access Type      | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Read-only**    | Only view data                  |
| **Read & Write** | View and modify data            |
| **Execute**      | Run stored procedures/functions |

### **3. Privileges**

#### **3.1 Database Privileges**

* Permission to execute a specific SQL statement or access database objects.
* Does not apply to DB administrators.

#### **3.2 System Privileges**

* Rights to perform activities across the **entire system**.
* Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP database objects.
* Usually granted by a **DBA**.

#### **3.3 Object Privileges**

* Rights to perform specific actions on a **particular object** (table, function, package).
* Examples: INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT.
* Usually granted by the **object owner**.

**Comparison: System vs Object Privileges**

| Feature    | System Privileges   | Object Privileges     |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Granted by | DBA                 | Object owner          |
| Scope      | Entire system       | Specific object       |
| Used for   | DDL statements      | DML statements        |
| Purpose    | Manage DB & servers | Operate on DB objects |

**Syntax Examples:**

```sql
-- System Privilege
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO user1;

-- Object Privilege
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user1;
```

### **4. Roles**

Roles simplify **privilege management** by grouping multiple privileges together.

**Purpose of Roles:**

* Group and manage privileges collectively
* Assign same privileges to multiple users
* Reduce administrative overhead

**Properties:**

* **Reduced privilege administration** – Grant privileges to role instead of each user
* **Dynamic privilege management** – Update role once; applies to all users
* **Application-specific security** – Role can be password-protected
* **Role hierarchies** – Some DBMS allow roles to inherit privileges from other roles

**Syntax Examples:**

```sql
-- Create Role
CREATE ROLE director_role;

-- Grant privileges to a role
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO intern_role;

-- Assign role to a user
GRANT director_role TO user1;
```

✅ **Key Takeaways:**

* **Privileges** control **what operations** users can perform
* **Roles** group privileges for **easier management**
* Use roles to **simplify administration** and maintain security
