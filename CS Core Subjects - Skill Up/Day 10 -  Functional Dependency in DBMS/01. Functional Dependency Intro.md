# **Day - 10 Functional Dependency in DBMS**

## **1. Functional Dependency in DBMS**

## **1. Introduction**

A **Functional Dependency (FD)** describes a relationship between two sets of attributes in a relation, where one attribute (or group of attributes) **uniquely determines** another.

It is represented as:

```
X → Y
```

* **X** → Determinant (the attribute(s) determining another)
* **Y** → Dependent attribute(s)

This means for every unique value of X, there exists **exactly one corresponding value** of Y.

## **2. Example**

Consider a table **Students(StudentID, StudentName, StudentAge)**

| StudentID | StudentName | StudentAge |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 101       | Rahul       | 23         |
| 102       | Ankit       | 22         |
| 103       | Aditya      | 22         |
| 104       | Sahil       | 24         |

Here,
`StudentID → StudentName`
means each StudentID uniquely determines a student’s name.

## **3. Representation of Functional Dependency**

Functional Dependency can be represented using arrows (`→`):

* Example:
  `EmployeeID → FirstName, LastName`
  means EmployeeID determines both FirstName and LastName.

Each dependency has two sides:

* **Left-hand side (LHS)** → Determinant
* **Right-hand side (RHS)** → Dependent attributes

Example:
If `X → Y, Z`
then knowing **X** determines **Y** and **Z**.

## **4. Types of Functional Dependencies**

### **a. Trivial Functional Dependency**

* Occurs when the dependent attribute is **a subset of the determinant**.
  Example:
  `EmployeeID, Name → Name`

---

### **b. Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**

* Occurs when **Y is not a subset of X** and the dependency `X → Y` holds true.
  Example:
  `StudentID → StudentName`

---

### **c. Multivalued Dependency**

* Exists when, for a given X, there are **multiple independent sets of Y and Z** values.
* The set of Y values is **independent** of Z values and vice versa.
  Example:
  `X →→ Y | Z`
  where Y and Z are independent given X.

---

### **d. Semi Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**

* A dependency `X → Y` is **semi non-trivial** when
  `X ∩ Y ≠ ∅` (i.e., X and Y share at least one common attribute).

---

### **e. Transitive Functional Dependency**

* Occurs when a non-key attribute is dependent on another **non-key** attribute via a third attribute.
  Example:
  If `A → B` and `B → C`, then `A → C` is a transitive dependency.

## **5. Armstrong’s Axioms for Functional Dependency**

Armstrong’s Axioms define inference rules used to derive all possible FDs logically implied by a given set of dependencies.

| **Axiom**        | **Definition**                                                          | **Example**                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reflexivity**  | If B is a subset of A, then A → B                                       | `{RollNo, Name} → Name`                            |
| **Augmentation** | If A → B holds, then adding the same attribute to both sides also holds | If A → B, then AC → BC                             |
| **Transitivity** | If A → B and B → C, then A → C                                          | If RollNo → Name and Name → Age, then RollNo → Age |

## **6. Benefits of Functional Dependency**

1. **Prevents Duplicate Data**

   * Minimizes redundancy by ensuring each piece of data is stored once.

2. **Improves Data Quality & Accuracy**

   * Enforces consistency and ensures reliable information.

3. **Reduces Errors**

   * Organized data reduces the likelihood of inconsistencies.

4. **Saves Time & Cost**

   * Streamlined queries and updates improve efficiency.

5. **Defines Data Rules & Behavior**

   * Supports defining constraints and data validation rules.

6. **Helps Identify Poor Database Design**

   * Highlights data anomalies and design flaws for correction.

---

### **Summary**

Functional Dependency is a **core concept in relational database design** that ensures **data consistency**, helps achieve **normalization**, and identifies **key relationships** between attributes.
Understanding and applying FDs correctly leads to a **more efficient, reliable, and maintainable** database schema.
