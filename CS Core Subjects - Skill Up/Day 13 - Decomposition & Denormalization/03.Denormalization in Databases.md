# **Day 13 — Denormalization in Databases**

## **1️⃣ Definition**

**Denormalization** is a **database optimization technique** where **redundant data is intentionally added** to one or more tables to **improve query performance**.

> Important points:
>
> * It is **not reversing normalization**.
> * Applied **after normalization** to optimize performance, especially for time-critical operations.
> * Helps **reduce costly joins** in relational databases.

## **2️⃣ Why Denormalization?**

* In **normalized databases**, data is split into multiple tables to **eliminate redundancy**.
* Example:

  * **Courses table:** stores teacherID, not teacherName
  * **Teachers table:** stores teacherName
  * To get course + teacherName → **join needed**
* If tables are large, **joins can be slow**.

**Denormalization compromise:**

* Allow **some redundancy** to gain **query efficiency**
* Accept **extra updates** for performance benefits.

---

## **3️⃣ Step 1: Unnormalized Table**

* **All data in a single table**
* Problems:

  * **Redundancy:** e.g., "Alice" or "Math" repeated
  * **Update Anomalies:** changing teacher name requires multiple updates
  * **Inefficient storage:** repeated info takes extra space

---

## **4️⃣ Step 2: Normalized Structure**

* Data is split into **smaller related tables**
* Each table focuses on a **specific aspect**: students, classes, subjects

**Advantages:**

* **No Redundancy:** Each piece of info stored once
* **Easier Updates:** Changing info in one table updates everywhere
* **Efficient Storage:** Eliminates repeated data

---

## **5️⃣ Step 3: Denormalized Table**

* Combine related tables back **for performance optimization**
* Stores **all relevant info in a single table**

**Advantages:**

* Reduces **complex joins**
* Queries are **faster and simpler**
* Trade-off: **some redundancy** and extra maintenance

## **6️⃣ Denormalization vs Normalization**

| Aspect  | Normalization                              | Denormalization                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Purpose | Reduce redundancy, maintain data integrity | Add redundancy to improve performance   |
| Focus   | Data integrity, storage efficiency         | Query speed, performance                |
| Method  | Split tables into smaller related tables   | Combine tables or add redundant columns |
| Usage   | Scalable systems for consistent updates    | Performance-critical queries            |

> In practice, **both are used together** in large systems for balance.

## **7️⃣ Advantages of Denormalization**

1. **Improved Query Performance:** Fewer joins, faster queries
2. **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer tables in queries
3. **Easier Maintenance & Updates:** Fewer joins for updates
4. **Better Read Performance:** Quick access to data
5. **Better Scalability:** Fewer joins improve overall system performance

---

## **8️⃣ Disadvantages of Denormalization**

1. **Reduced Data Integrity:** Redundant data can cause inconsistencies
2. **Increased Complexity:** Redundant data may complicate schema
3. **Increased Storage Requirements:** Extra space needed
4. **Update & Maintenance Complexity:** Redundant data increases update effort
5. **Limited Flexibility:** Harder to modify schema due to redundancy

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Denormalization is used **after normalization** for **performance optimization**.
* **Redundancy is intentional** to reduce joins and improve query speed.
* Must balance **performance** with **data integrity**.
