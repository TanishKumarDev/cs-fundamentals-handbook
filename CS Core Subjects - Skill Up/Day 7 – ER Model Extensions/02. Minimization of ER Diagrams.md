## Article 2: Minimization of ER Diagrams

### **1. Overview**

Minimization of an ER Diagram means **reducing the number of tables** in the design to make it simpler, more readable, and efficient. Large ER diagrams with many tables can be hard to understand, maintain, and query. Minimization focuses on **optimizing table usage** based on relationships and cardinality.

**Benefits of Minimization:**

* **Improved Readability:** Fewer tables make the ER diagram easier to visualize.
* **Better Understandability:** Simpler relationships are easier to interpret.
* **Efficient Storage and Maintenance:** Reduces redundancy and complexity.
* **Faster Query Processing:** Optimized structures improve performance.

### **2. Cardinality in ER Diagrams**

Cardinality defines **how many instances of one entity relate to instances of another entity**. The four types of cardinality are:

1. **One-to-One (1:1):** Each entity in set A relates to at most one entity in set B, and vice versa.
2. **One-to-Many (1:N):** One entity in set A can relate to multiple entities in set B; each entity in B relates to only one entity in A.
3. **Many-to-One (N:1):** Opposite of 1:N.
4. **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Multiple entities in set A can relate to multiple entities in set B, and vice versa.

### **3. One-to-One Cardinality**

**Definition:** One record in a table relates to only one record in another table.

**Cases:**

**Case A – Total Participation at One End:**

* All entities in one table must participate.
* **Action:** Merge the two tables into **one table**.
* Example: Entities E1 and E2, with total participation at E1. E1’s primary key remains, and all entries in E2 must relate to E1.

**Case B – Partial Participation:**

* Some entities do not fully participate.
* **Action:** Avoid merging all three tables (two entities + relationship) to prevent NULLs.
* Merge the relationship table with one entity table.
* **Result:** Minimum of **two tables** required: one entity table and one merged relationship table.

### **4. One-to-Many (1:N) or Many-to-One (N:1) Cardinality**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716181509338042/2.webp)

**Definition:** One entity on the "one" side can relate to multiple entities on the "many" side.

**Example:**

* **Entities:** Student(SID, Name), Course(CID, C_name)
* **Relationship:** Enroll

**Tables Before Minimization:**

| Student | SID | Name |
| ------- | --- | ---- |
| 1       | A   |      |
| 2       | B   |      |

| Course | CID | C_name |
| ------ | --- | ------ |
| C1     | Z   |        |
| C2     | Y   |        |

| Enroll | SID | CID |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| 1      | C1  |     |
| 2      | C1  |     |

**Minimization:**

* Merge **Student** and **Enroll** into **Student_Enroll** table.

| Student_Enroll | SID | Name | CID |
| -------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
| 1              | A   | C1   |     |
| 2              | B   | C1   |     |

* Minimum **2 tables** required: **Student_Enroll** and **Course**.

---

### **5. Many-to-Many (M:N) Cardinality**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716181829950977/MantoMany.webp)

**Definition:** Multiple entities in one set can relate to multiple entities in another.

**Example:** A student can enroll in **multiple courses**.

| Student | SID | Name |
| ------- | --- | ---- |
| 1       | A   |      |
| 2       | B   |      |

| Course | CID | C_name |
| ------ | --- | ------ |
| C1     | Z   |        |
| C2     | Y   |        |

| Enroll | SID | CID |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| 1      | C1  |     |
| 1      | C2  |     |
| 2      | C1  |     |
| 2      | C2  |     |

**Primary Key for Enroll:** `(SID, CID)`

* **Merging:** Cannot merge Enroll with Student or Course without creating redundancy.
* **Result:** Minimum **3 tables** required: **Student**, **Course**, and **Enroll**.

### **6. Summary Table of Minimization**

| Relationship Type                  | Primary Key Consideration     | Minimum Tables Required | Notes                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| One-to-One (Total Participation)   | Key of other side             | 1                       | Merge entity tables                      |
| One-to-One (Partial Participation) | Key of relationship or entity | 2                       | Merge relationship with one entity       |
| One-to-Many / Many-to-One          | Key of “one” side             | 2                       | Merge entity with relationship table     |
| Many-to-Many                       | Combined key of both entities | 3                       | Separate table for relationship required |

**Key Takeaways:**

* Minimization simplifies ER diagrams, improves readability, and reduces complexity.
* Always consider **cardinality** and **participation** before merging tables.
* One-to-One and One-to-Many relationships allow merging for minimization; Many-to-Many requires a separate table.
