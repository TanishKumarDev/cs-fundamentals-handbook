# Day 8 – Tuples in DBMS

## **1. What is a Tuple?**

* A **tuple** in a DBMS refers to a **single row** in a relational table.
* Each tuple contains **values for all attributes (columns)** of that table.
* Tuples are **unique** and usually identified using a **primary key**, which prevents duplicates.
* Tuples can also be linked to other tables using **foreign keys**, establishing relationships between data.

**Origin:** The concept comes from the **Relational Model** by E.F. Codd, where data is stored as tables (relations) containing **collections of unique tuples**.

## **2. Example of Tuples**

**Relation R (Table) with 3 Columns: Geeks, For, Geeks**

| Geeks | For | Geeks |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| a1    | b1  | c1    |
| a2    | b1  | c2    |

* Each **row** `(a1, b1, c1)` is a **tuple**.
* Represents a **single record** in the table.

**CUSTOMER Table Example:**

| customer_id | first_name | last_name | email                                 |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1           | John       | Smith     | [abc@gmail.com](mailto:abc@gmail.com) |
| 2           | Abhishek   | Bhosle    | [cde@gmail.com](mailto:cde@gmail.com) |
| 3           | Natasha    | Witch     | [fgh@gmail.com](mailto:fgh@gmail.com) |

* Each row is a **tuple** containing data for one customer.

## **3. Role of Tuples in Normalization**

* **Normalization** organizes data to minimize redundancy and improve integrity.
* Tuples are split into multiple tables with **specific attributes**.

**Example:**

Un-normalized **ORDER Table**

| order_id | customer_id | product_id | quantity |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A        | 1           | AAA1       | 5        |
| B        | 2           | BBB1       | 6        |
| C        | 3           | CCC1       | 7        |
| D        | 4           | BBB1       | 4        |

* Normalized:

  * `Orders` Table → `{order_id, customer_id}`
  * `Order_Details` Table → `{product_id, quantity}`

* Each **tuple** in the smaller tables contains only the relevant attributes.

---

## **4. Role of Tuples in Queries**

* Queries retrieve **specific tuples** from a table based on conditions.
* Example: Retrieve `first_name` and `last_name` of customers with a certain email → **query result is a set of tuples** matching the condition.

---

## **5. Types of Tuples**

### **5.1 Physical Tuples**

* Refers to **how data is stored on disk or memory** in binary/encoded form.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Exists at the **physical level** of the database
  * Stored as **bytes or disk blocks**
  * Contains **metadata** (Tuple ID, pointers, slot numbers, NULL indicators)
  * Optimized for **performance and indexing**

### **5.2 Logical Tuples**

* Refers to the **user-visible representation** of a row.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Exists at the **logical/conceptual level**
  * Represents **attribute values** clearly for users
  * Independent of storage on disk
  * Seen in **SQL queries, forms, reports**

> Note: Both physical and logical tuples contain the same attributes but differ in representation and usage.

### **6. Summary**

| Aspect         | Physical Tuple                      | Logical Tuple                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Level          | Storage/Physical                    | Conceptual/Logical              |
| Representation | Binary, bytes, disk blocks          | Attributes & values (user-view) |
| Metadata       | TID, pointers, slot numbers, NULL   | Not required                    |
| Use            | Optimized for performance, indexing | Seen by users, used in queries  |

* Tuples are **fundamental units of data** in a relational database.
* They are used for **data storage, normalization, querying**, and establishing **relationships** between tables.
