# Day 8 – Introduction to Relations

## Article 1: Relational Model in DBMS

### **1. What is the Relational Model?**

The **Relational Model** is a way to organize data in a database using **tables** (also called **relations**) consisting of **rows** and **columns**.

* Each **row** represents an entity or record (**tuple**).
* Each **column** represents an attribute or property of the entity.
* The relational model is used to **transform conceptual designs** (like ER diagrams) into a structure that can be implemented in databases such as **Oracle SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSQL**.

**Example:**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250111112649494919/relational_model-1024.webp)

| ROLL_NO | NAME   | ADDRESS | PHONE      | AGE |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | --- |
| 1       | RAM    | DELHI   | 9455123451 | 18  |
| 2       | RAMESH | GURGAON | 9652431543 | 18  |
| 3       | SUJIT  | ROHTAK  | 9156253131 | 20  |
| 4       | SURESH | DELHI   | NULL       | 18  |

This table is a **relation** called `STUDENT` with attributes **ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE, AGE**.

---

### **2. Key Terms in Relational Model**

1. **Attribute:** Property that defines an entity.

   * Example: `ROLL_NO`, `NAME`, `ADDRESS`.

2. **Relation Schema:** Structure of a relation showing its name and attributes.

   * Example: `STUDENT(ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE, AGE)`

3. **Tuple:** A single row in a relation.

   * Example: `(1, RAM, DELHI, 9455123451, 18)`

4. **Relation Instance:** Set of tuples at a specific time.

   * Changes with insert, delete, or update operations.

5. **Degree:** Number of attributes in a relation.

   * Example: `STUDENT` has degree **5**.

6. **Cardinality:** Number of tuples in a relation.

   * Example: `STUDENT` table has cardinality **4**.

7. **NULL Values:** Represents unknown or unavailable data.

   * Example: `PHONE` of SURESH is NULL.

### **3. Types of Keys**

1. **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each tuple. Cannot be NULL.
2. **Candidate Key:** Attributes that can uniquely identify tuples.
3. **Super Key:** Any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.
4. **Foreign Key:** An attribute that references a primary key in another relation.
5. **Composite Key:** Combination of two or more attributes to uniquely identify a tuple.

---

### **4. Notation in Relational Model**

* **Relation Schema:** `R(A1, A2, ..., An)`
* **Relation Name:** Uppercase (R, S, T)
* **Relation State (tuples):** Lowercase (r, s, t)
* **Tuples:** `t = <v1, v2,..., vn>`
* Access attribute value: `t[Ai]` or `t.Ai`
* Qualified attribute: `R.A` (e.g., `STUDENT.Name`)

### **5. Characteristics of Relational Model**

1. **Data Representation:** Organized in tables with rows and columns.
2. **Atomic Values:** Each attribute holds a single value.
3. **Unique Keys:** Each table has a primary key.
4. **Attribute Domain:** Each attribute has a data type (integer, varchar, date, etc.).
5. **Data Independence:** Schema changes do not affect applications.
6. **Relational Operations:** Supports selection, projection, join, union, intersection.
7. **Data Consistency:** Maintained using constraints.
8. **Set-Based Representation:** Tables are treated as mathematical sets.

---

### **6. Constraints in Relational Model**

**Constraints** ensure that data is valid and consistent.

1. **Domain Constraints:**

   * Attribute values must belong to a defined domain (e.g., integer, varchar, date).

2. **Key Integrity:**

   * Primary keys must be unique and NOT NULL.
   * Example: `ROLL_NO` in STUDENT uniquely identifies each student.

3. **Referential Integrity Constraints:**

   * Ensures that foreign key values in one table match primary key values in another table.
   * Example:

**STUDENT Table:**

| ROLL_NO | NAME   | BRANCH_CODE |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1       | RAM    | CS          |
| 2       | RAMESH | CS          |
| 3       | SUJIT  | ECE         |
| 4       | SURESH | IT          |

**BRANCH Table:**

| BRANCH_CODE | BRANCH_NAME                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| CS          | COMPUTER SCIENCE            |
| IT          | INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY      |
| ECE         | ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATION |
| CV          | CIVIL                       |

* Here, `BRANCH_CODE` in STUDENT **must exist** in BRANCH table.
* **Referencing Relation:** STUDENT
* **Referenced Relation:** BRANCH

---

### **7. Anomalies in Relational Model**

1. **Insertion Anomaly:** Cannot insert a tuple if referenced value does not exist.

   * Example: Adding a student with `BRANCH_CODE = ME` fails because ME is not in BRANCH.

2. **Deletion/Update Anomaly:** Cannot delete/update referenced value if it is used in another table.

   * Example: Cannot delete `BRANCH_CODE = CS` from BRANCH if it is used in STUDENT.

### **8. Codd’s Rules for Relational Databases**

E.F. Codd defined **12 rules** to ensure a proper relational database.

**Key Rules:**

1. **Information Rule:** All information stored logically in tables.
2. **Guaranteed Access Rule:** Every data element accessible via table name, primary key, and attribute.
3. **Powerful Language Rule:** Must support a comprehensive query language (like SQL).

---

### **9. Advantages of Relational Model**

* Simple and easy to use.
* Flexible for queries and schema changes.
* Secure and accurate.
* Maintains data integrity.
* Operations like selection, projection, and join are easy.

---

### **10. Disadvantages of Relational Model**

* May perform slowly for **very large databases**.
* Complex data relationships (hierarchies, networks) are harder to represent.
* Extensive normalization can make queries complex and slower.
