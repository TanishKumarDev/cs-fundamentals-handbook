# **Day 12 — Second Normal Form (2NF)**

###**Definition**

A table is in **Second Normal Form (2NF)** if:

1. It is already in **First Normal Form (1NF)**.
2. It has **no partial dependencies** — i.e., **no non-prime attribute depends only on part of a composite key**.

👉 **Focus:** Eliminate *partial dependency* to reduce redundancy and improve data consistency.

---

###**Key Concept — Fully Functional Dependency**

* A **non-key attribute** should depend on the **entire primary key**, not just a part of it.
* If dependency exists on only part of a composite key → ❌ **Partial Dependency** → violates 2NF.

---

###**What is Partial Dependency?**

A **partial dependency** exists if:

> A non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on **a part of a composite key**, not the entire key.

**Example:**
If `{A, B}` → `C` and `A` → `C`,
then `C` depends on part of `{A, B}` → **Partial Dependency**.

---

### 📘 **Example**

**Student-Course Table:**

| STUD_NO | COURSE_NO | COURSE_FEE |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| S01     | DBMS      | 2000       |
| S02     | OOP       | 2500       |
| S03     | DBMS      | 2000       |

* Candidate key = `{STUD_NO, COURSE_NO}`
* Non-prime attribute = `COURSE_FEE`
* `COURSE_NO → COURSE_FEE` (depends on part of key)
  → **Partial Dependency** → ❌ Not in 2NF

**After applying 2NF:**

**1️⃣ Course Table**

| COURSE_NO | COURSE_FEE |
| --------- | ---------- |
| DBMS      | 2000       |
| OOP       | 2500       |

**2️⃣ Student-Course Table**

| STUD_NO | COURSE_NO |
| ------- | --------- |
| S01     | DBMS      |
| S02     | OOP       |
| S03     | DBMS      |

✅ Now, each non-prime attribute depends fully on the key → **In 2NF**

---

###**Advantages of 2NF**

* Removes **partial dependency**
* Reduces **data redundancy**
* Improves **data consistency and accuracy**

---

###**Limitations of 2NF**

1. ❌ Still allows **transitive dependencies** (A → B → C).
2. ⚙️ May still have **redundancy** in complex datasets.
3. 🧩 More complex when using **multi-attribute (composite) keys**.
4. 🚀 Requires further normalization → move to **3NF** to handle transitive dependencies.

### ✅ **Summary**

| Rule | Description                             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1NF  | No multi-valued or composite attributes |
| 2NF  | No partial dependencies                 |
| 3NF  | No transitive dependencies              |
