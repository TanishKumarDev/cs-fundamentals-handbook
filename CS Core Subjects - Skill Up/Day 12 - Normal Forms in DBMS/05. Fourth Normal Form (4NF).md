# **Day 12 â€” Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

###  **Definition**

Fourth Normal Form (4NF) handles **multivalued dependencies (MVDs)** in a relation.

* **Multivalued Dependency (A â†’â†’ B):** One attribute determines multiple independent values of another attribute, **independent of other attributes**.
* Requires **at least 3 attributes**: two dependent on a third.

**Example of MVD:**

* A course has multiple instructors **and** multiple textbook authors.
* Instructors and authors are **independent of each other**.

---

###  **Rule for 4NF**

A relation R is in 4NF if:

1. It is in **BCNF**.
2. It has **no non-trivial multivalued dependencies** other than a candidate key.

**Key Idea:**

* 4NF **eliminates redundancy** caused by multiple independent one-to-many relationships in a single table.

### ðŸ“˜ **Example**

**Original Table:**

| Course     | Instructor | TextBook_Author |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Management | X          | Churchill       |
| Management | Y          | Peters          |
| Management | Z          | Peters          |
| Finance    | A          | Weston          |
| Finance    | A          | Gilbert         |

**Problem:**

* Each course has multiple instructors.
* Each course has multiple textbook authors.
* Instructor and author are independent â†’ **violates 4NF**.

**Solution: Decompose into two tables**

**Table R1 â€” Course â†’â†’ Instructor**

| Course     | Instructor |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Management | X          |
| Management | Y          |
| Management | Z          |
| Finance    | A          |

**Table R2 â€” Course â†’â†’ TextBook_Author**

| Course     | TextBook_Author |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Management | Churchill       |
| Management | Peters          |
| Finance    | Weston          |
| Finance    | Gilbert         |

âœ… Both tables now satisfy **BCNF and 4NF**.

###  **Benefits of 4NF**

1. **No redundant combinations:** Eliminates Cartesian product effect.
2. **Single multivalued dependency per table:** Clear dependency, easier understanding.
3. **Efficient storage:** Fewer rows, less space, better performance.
4. **No anomalies:**

   * Insertion: Can add instructor without a textbook.
   * Deletion: Removing a textbook doesnâ€™t remove instructors.
   * Update: Change happens in one place only.
5. **Cleaner design:** Easier maintenance and future-proofing.
