## Article 1: Introduction to ER Model

### **1. Overview**

The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a conceptual tool used to design databases. It represents the **logical structure** of a database, showing:

* **Entities** – Real-world objects or concepts stored as data (e.g., Student, Course, Employee).
* **Attributes** – Properties of entities (e.g., StudentID, CourseName, EmployeeEmail).
* **Relationships** – Connections between entities (e.g., a Student enrolls in a Course).

**ER Diagram (ERD)** is the graphical representation of the ER model.

### **3. Entity and Entity Set**

* **Entity** – A single object or concept.
  Examples: Person, Car, Course.
* **Entity Set** – Collection of all entities of the same type.
  Example: All students form the Student entity set.

**Types of Entities:**

1. **Strong Entity** – Has a unique key attribute; independent.
2. **Weak Entity** – Cannot be uniquely identified alone; depends on a strong entity.

### **4. Attributes**

| Type                  | Description                                                    | ERD Symbol                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Key Attribute         | Uniquely identifies an entity (e.g., Roll_No)                  | Underlined ellipse                      |
| Composite Attribute   | Made of multiple sub-attributes (e.g., Address → Street, City) | Ellipse with smaller connected ellipses |
| Multivalued Attribute | Holds multiple values (e.g., Phone_No)                         | Double ellipse                          |
| Derived Attribute     | Can be calculated from other attributes (e.g., Age from DOB)   | Dashed ellipse                          |

### **5. Relationships**

* **Relationship Type** – Defines association between entity types (e.g., “Enrolled in” between Student and Course).
* **Relationship Set** – Collection of all relationships of the same type.

**Degree of Relationship:**

| Degree          | Description                   | Example                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Unary/Recursive | One entity set participates   | Person married to Person   |
| Binary          | Two entity sets participate   | Student enrolled in Course |
| Ternary         | Three entity sets participate | Doctor, Patient, Medicine  |
| N-ary           | N entity sets participate     | Complex relationships      |

---

### **6. Cardinality**

Defines **maximum number of relationships** an entity can participate in:

| Type         | Description                                   | Example                                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One-to-One   | Each entity participates once                 | One male marries one female                                        |
| One-to-Many  | One entity relates to multiple entities       | One department has many doctors                                    |
| Many-to-One  | Many entities relate to one                   | Many students take one course                                      |
| Many-to-Many | Multiple entities relate to multiple entities | Students enroll in multiple courses; each course has many students |

### **7. Participation Constraint**

* **Total Participation** – Every entity must participate (double line).
* **Partial Participation** – Some entities may not participate (single line).

Example: Every student must enroll in a course (total participation), but some courses may have no students yet (partial participation).

### **8. Steps to Draw an ER Diagram**

1. Identify entities and represent as rectangles.
2. Identify relationships and represent as diamonds; connect appropriately.
3. Add attributes as ovals; underline primary keys.
4. Define primary keys for each entity.
5. Remove redundant entities or relationships.
6. Review the diagram for clarity and accuracy.
