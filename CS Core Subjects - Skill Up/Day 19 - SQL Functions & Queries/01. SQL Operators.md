# **Day 19 - SQL Functions & Queries: SQL Operators**

SQL operators are **symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data** in SQL queries. They allow you to:

* Perform calculations on data
* Compare values
* Combine logical conditions
* Manipulate individual bits
* Assign and modify values
* Filter data using special criteria

---

## **1. Arithmetic Operators**

**Purpose:** Perform **mathematical operations** on numeric columns.

| Operator | Meaning             | Example          |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `SELECT 10 + 5;` |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `SELECT 10 - 5;` |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `SELECT 10 * 5;` |
| `/`      | Division            | `SELECT 10 / 5;` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `SELECT 10 % 3;` |

**Example: Calculate Revised Salary**

```sql
SELECT emp_salary, emp_salary * 1.05 AS revised_salary
FROM employee;
```

**Explanation:** Multiplies the current salary by 1.05 (5% increment) and shows both old and new salaries.

---

## **2. Comparison Operators**

**Purpose:** Compare values for **equality, inequality, or magnitude**.

| Operator     | Meaning               | Example                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `=`          | Equal to              | `SELECT * FROM maths WHERE marks = 50;`  |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equal to          | `SELECT * FROM maths WHERE marks <> 50;` |
| `>`          | Greater than          | `SELECT * FROM maths WHERE marks > 50;`  |
| `<`          | Less than             | `SELECT * FROM maths WHERE marks < 50;`  |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal | `SELECT * FROM maths WHERE marks >= 50;` |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal    | `SELECT * FROM maths WHERE marks <= 50;` |

**Example:** Fetch students with marks equal to 50.

## **3. Logical Operators**

**Purpose:** Combine **multiple conditions** in a query.

| Operator | Meaning                                    | Example                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AND`    | True if **both** conditions are true       | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city='Allahabad' AND country='India';` |
| `OR`     | True if **at least one** condition is true | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city='Delhi' OR city='Mumbai';`        |
| `NOT`    | Reverses the boolean value                 | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE NOT city='Delhi';`                     |

**Explanation:** Logical operators allow filtering with multiple conditions.

---

## **4. Bitwise Operators**

**Purpose:** Perform operations **at the binary level** of numeric data.

| Operator | Meaning     | Example       |    |        |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | -- | ------ |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND | `5 & 3` → 1   |    |        |
| `        | `           | Bitwise OR    | `5 | 3` → 7 |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR | `5 ^ 3` → 6   |    |        |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT | `~5` → -6     |    |        |
| `<<`     | Left shift  | `5 << 1` → 10 |    |        |
| `>>`     | Right shift | `5 >> 1` → 2  |    |        |

**Explanation:** Useful in low-level operations or flag-based systems.

---

## **5. Compound Operators**

**Purpose:** Perform an operation and **assign result** to a column in a single step.

| Operator | Meaning                | Example                   |        |       |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| `+=`     | Add and assign         | `SET x += 5;` (x = x + 5) |        |       |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign    | `SET x -= 5;`             |        |       |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign    | `SET x *= 5;`             |        |       |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign      | `SET x /= 5;`             |        |       |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign     | `SET x %= 5;`             |        |       |
| `&=`     | Bitwise AND and assign | `SET x &= 5;`             |        |       |
| `        | =`                     | Bitwise OR and assign     | `SET x | = 5;` |
| `^=`     | Bitwise XOR and assign | `SET x ^= 5;`             |        |       |

**Explanation:** Saves writing long expressions; used in updates and loops.

## **6. Special Operators**

**Purpose:** Perform **range, set, or subquery-based comparisons**.

| Operator  | Purpose                                        | Example                                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALL`     | Compare value to **all values** from subquery  | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employee WHERE dept='HR');`  |
| `ANY`     | True if **any value** matches                  | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employee WHERE dept='HR');`  |
| `BETWEEN` | Check **value in a range**                     | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 101 AND 104;`                                  |
| `IN`      | Check **value in a set**                       | `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dept IN ('HR','IT','Sales');`                                 |
| `EXISTS`  | Checks **if subquery returns rows**            | `SELECT * FROM employee e WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dept d WHERE d.dept_id = e.dept_id);` |
| `SOME`    | True if **condition matches at least one row** | Similar to `ANY`                                                                            |
| `UNIQUE`  | Ensures **result rows are unique**             | `SELECT UNIQUE dept FROM employee;`                                                         |

**Explanation:** These operators are crucial for **advanced filtering, subqueries, and set-based operations**.

---

### **Example: Using Special Operator**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 101 AND 104;
```

**Output:** Only employees with `emp_id` in the range 101 to 104 are returned.
