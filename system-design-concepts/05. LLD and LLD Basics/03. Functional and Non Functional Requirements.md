## What are Functional Requirements?

Functional requirements specify the features and operations a system must provide to meet business and user needs. They focus on **what** the system should do, detailing interactions between the system and its users.

**Key Features**:
- Describe specific functionalities or tasks (e.g., user authentication, data processing).
- Directly requested by users and observable in the final product.
- Documented as use cases, user stories, or functional specifications.

**Examples**:
- User authentication (e.g., login with username and password).
- Data entry and processing (e.g., submitting a form).
- Search functionality (e.g., searching a product catalog).
- Payment handling (e.g., processing credit card transactions).
- Report generation (e.g., generating sales reports).

**Guiding Questions**:
- What features must the system include?
- What edge cases should be considered in the design?

**Analogy**:
- Functional requirements are like a recipe’s ingredients and steps, defining exactly what dishes (features) the system must produce.

## What are Non-Functional Requirements?

Non-functional requirements define **how** a system should operate, focusing on performance, quality, and user experience. They ensure the system is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly, shaping its long-term success.

**Key Aspects**:
- **Performance**: Speed and responsiveness of the system.
- **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access or breaches.
- **Usability**: Ease of use and intuitive interfaces.
- **Reliability**: Consistent operation with minimal failures.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased loads.
- **Maintainability**: Ease of updating or fixing the system.
- **Portability**: Compatibility across different environments or devices.

**Examples**:

## Importance of Balancing Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Balancing both types of requirements is crucial for a successful system:
1. **Improves User Experience**:
   - Functional requirements ensure features work, but non-functional requirements (e.g., usability, performance) make the system responsive and user-friendly.
   - Example: A banking app with login functionality (functional) must load quickly (non-functional) to avoid frustration.

2. **Enhances System Performance**:
   - Non-functional requirements like scalability and reliability ensure the system handles real-world loads effectively.
   - Example: A food delivery app must scale to handle peak-hour orders without crashing.

3. **Prevents Bottlenecks and Failures**:
   - Addressing non-functional needs (e.g., reliability, security) reduces outages or breaches.
   - Example: Encrypting transactions prevents security breaches in an online banking system.

4. **Reduces Long-Term Costs**:
   - Early focus on non-functional requirements (e.g., maintainability) avoids costly rework or performance fixes.
   - Example: Designing a scalable architecture prevents expensive redesigns as user numbers grow.

5. **Supports System Evolution**:
   - Non-functional requirements like extensibility enable future upgrades and feature additions.
   - Example: A modular design allows adding new features to a delivery app without major changes.

## Common Challenges in Defining Requirements

1. **Ambiguity in Requirements**:
   - Vague or incomplete requirements make it hard to define functionalities or performance goals.
   - Example: Unclear user needs for a feature lead to misaligned development.

2. **Changing Requirements**:
   - Evolving business goals or user expectations cause requirement shifts, disrupting design.
   - Example: New regulations require changes to a banking system’s security features.

3. **Difficulty in Prioritization**:
   - Balancing functional and non-functional needs is challenging, with functional often prioritized over critical non-functional aspects.

   - Example: Specify “login in under 1 second” instead of “fast login.”

2. **Prioritize Requirements**:
   - Rank functional and non-functional needs based on business goals and user impact.
   - Example: Prioritize security over minor feature additions in a banking system.

3. **Document Thoroughly**:
   - Use user stories for functional requirements and technical specs for non-functional ones.
   - Example: Document “user can track order” as a user story and “support 50,000 concurrent users” as a spec.

4. **Validate Early and Often**:
   - Test functional requirements with prototypes and non-functional ones with benchmarks.
   - Example: Prototype a login feature and test scalability under load.

5. **Engage Stakeholders Continuously**:
   - Involve users, developers, and business teams throughout to align requirements.
   - Example: Regular stakeholder reviews to refine delivery app features.

6. **Balance Trade-Offs**:
   - Address conflicts (e.g., performance vs. security) through careful analysis.
   - Example: Optimize encryption to minimize impact on transaction speed.
