## **1. Introduction to Notification Systems**

### **1.1 What is a Notification System?**
A **notification system** is a backend infrastructure that delivers messages to users across multiple channels (e.g., email, push notifications, in-app alerts, SMS) in response to specific events (e.g., user signup, friend request, post creation). It is designed to be:
- **Multi-Channel**: Supports email, push, SMS, in-app, WhatsApp, etc.
- **Reliable**: Ensures delivery even during failures.
- **Scalable**: Handles millions of notifications per second.
- **User-Centric**: Respects user preferences and context (e.g., online/offline status).
- **Rate-Limited**: Adheres to external service constraints.

### **1.2 Why Notification Systems are Challenging?**
- **High Volume**: Social media platforms generate millions of events (e.g., signups, posts, friend requests).
- **Diverse Channels**: Each channel (email, push, SMS) has unique requirements and limitations.
- **Rate Limits**: External services (e.g., SendGrid, Firebase) impose strict limits (e.g., 30 emails/second).
- **User Experience**: Over-notification can annoy users; under-notification can reduce engagement.
- **Reliability**: Failures in external services must not disrupt core application functionality.
- **Complexity**: Managing user preferences, online status, and delivery priority adds significant logic.

---

## **2. Evolution of Notification System Design**

### **2.1 Naive Synchronous Approach**
In the simplest form, notifications are sent synchronously within the application flow.

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
app.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
    const { firstName, email, password } = req.body;
    
    // Save user to database
    await db.users.create({ firstName, email, password });
    
    // Synchronously send welcome email
    await sendEmail(email, 'Welcome to our platform!'); // Blocks for 3+ seconds
    
    res.json({ success: true });
});
```

**Challenges**:
| Issue | Impact | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Added Latency** | External API calls (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) add 3-5 seconds to signup | User waits longer for response |
| **External Dependency** | If email service is down, signup fails | 0.01% downtime in SendGrid crashes signup |
| **Rate Limiting** | External services limit requests (e.g., 30 emails/sec) | 100 signups/sec → 70 fail due to rate limits |
| **No Retry Mechanism** | Failed emails are lost | User never receives welcome email |
| **Scalability** | Synchronous calls don’t scale with high traffic | 1000 signups/sec overwhelm the server |

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Simple to implement, no additional infrastructure.
- **Cons**: Poor scalability, high latency, brittle due to external dependencies.

**Reasoning**: Synchronous calls couple the notification system tightly with the core application, making it unsuitable for high-traffic scenarios or unreliable external services.

### **2.2 Asynchronous with Dedicated Worker**
To address latency and dependency issues, notifications are offloaded to a separate server/worker.

**Architecture**:
```
Users → Web Server → Database
                ↓
           Email Server → Email Service (e.g., SendGrid)
```

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
app.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
    const { firstName, email, password } = req.body;
    
    // Save user
    await db.users.create({ firstName, email, password });
    
    // Offload to email server
    await emailServer.sendRequest({ email, message: 'Welcome!' });
    
    res.json({ success: true }); // Immediate response
});
```

**Improvements**:
- **Reduced Latency**: Signup flow doesn’t wait for email delivery.
- **Decoupled Failure**: Email server failures don’t affect signup.

**Challenges**:
- **Rate Limiting Persists**: If 100 users sign up simultaneously, 70 emails fail due to rate limits (e.g., 30 emails/sec).
- **No Retry Logic**: Failed emails are still lost.
- **Scalability Limits**: Email server becomes a bottleneck under high load.

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Faster user response, partial decoupling.
- **Cons**: Rate limiting issues, no retry mechanism, email server scalability concerns.

**Reasoning**: While this approach improves latency, it doesn’t solve rate limiting or ensure reliable delivery, limiting its scalability.

### **2.3 Queue-Based Asynchronous Design**
Introduce a message queue to handle rate limiting and retries.

**Architecture**:
```
Users → Web Server → Database
                ↓
           Email Queue → Worker → Email Service
```

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
const emailQueue = new Queue('email-queue');

app.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
    const { firstName, email, password } = req.body;
    
    // Save user
    await db.users.create({ firstName, email, password });
    
    // Enqueue email job (O(1) operation)
    await emailQueue.add({ email, message: 'Welcome!' });
    
    res.json({ success: true });
});

// Worker
emailQueue.process(async (job) => {
    try {
        await sendEmail(job.data.email, job.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
        // Retry logic
        if (job.attemptsMade < 3) throw error;
        // Move to Dead Letter Queue
        await deadLetterQueue.add(job.data);
    }
});
```

**Improvements**:
- **Rate Limiting Control**: Workers process messages at a controlled rate (e.g., 25 emails/sec vs. 30 limit).
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed messages are retried.
- **Decoupled Delivery**: Web server is unaffected by email failures.

**Challenges**:
- **Infinite Retries**: Continuous failures (e.g., service down for hours) can create infinite retry loops.
- **Single Channel**: Only supports email; adding push or in-app notifications requires new queues.
- **No User Context**: No logic to respect user preferences or online status.

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Handles rate limits, supports retries, fully decouples notifications.
- **Cons**: Risk of infinite retries, complex to extend for multiple channels.

**Reasoning**: Queues solve rate limiting and reliability but need additional mechanisms for retries and multi-channel support.

### **2.4 Event-Driven Fan-Out Architecture**
To support multiple channels and dynamic routing, adopt an **event-driven architecture** using a pub/sub system (e.g., AWS SNS).

**Architecture**:
```
Users → Load Balancer → Web Servers → Database
                           ↓
                        SNS (Pub/Sub)
                           ↓
        ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
        ↓                 ↓                 ↓
    Email Queue      Push Queue       In-App Queue
        ↓                 ↓                 ↓
    Email Worker    Push Worker      In-App Worker
        ↓                 ↓                 ↓
     SES/SendGrid    Firebase FCM      WebSocket
```

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
const sns = new AWS.SNS();

app.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
    const { firstName, email, password } = req.body;
    
    // Save user
    await db.users.create({ firstName, email, password });
    
    // Publish event
    await sns.publish({
        TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:region:account:user-events',
        Message: JSON.stringify({
            eventType: 'user.signup',
            userId: user.id,
            email,
            firstName
        })
    }).promise();
    
    res.json({ success: true });
});

// SNS Topic Subscriptions
const subscriptions = [
    { topic: 'user.signup', queue: 'email-queue' },
    { topic: 'user.signup', queue: 'in-app-queue' },
    { topic: 'friend.request', queue: 'push-queue' }
];
```

**Improvements**:
- **Loose Coupling**: New channels (e.g., SMS, WhatsApp) added via SNS subscriptions without code changes.
- **Scalability**: Independent queues and workers scale separately.
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic routing based on event types (e.g., signup → email + in-app, friend request → push).

**Challenges**:
- **Complex Configuration**: Managing SNS subscriptions and filters.
- **User Context**: Still no logic for user preferences or online status.
- **Retry Complexity**: Each queue needs its own retry and DLQ logic.

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Highly scalable, extensible, decoupled.
- **Cons**: Increased complexity in configuration and monitoring.

**Reasoning**: Event-driven architecture is the industry standard for large-scale notification systems, enabling flexibility and scalability while minimizing code changes.

## **3. Core Concepts in Notification Systems**

### **3.1 Asynchronous Processing**
- **Why?** Decouples notification delivery from user-facing operations, reducing latency and improving reliability.
- **How?** Use message queues (e.g., AWS SQS, RabbitMQ) to enqueue tasks and workers to process them.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Pros**: Fast user response, fault isolation.
  - **Cons**: Requires queue infrastructure and monitoring.
- **Reasoning**: Async processing is critical for scalability, as synchronous calls block user flows and don’t handle failures well.

### **3.2 Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Why?** Enables loose coupling and dynamic routing of notifications to multiple channels.
- **How?** Use a pub/sub system (e.g., AWS SNS, Kafka) to publish events and route them to appropriate queues.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Pros**: Easy to add new channels, scalable.
  - **Cons**: Complex setup, potential message duplication.
- **Reasoning**: Pub/sub systems like SNS allow dynamic configuration, making the system adaptable to changing requirements.

### **3.3 Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- **Why?** External services impose strict limits (e.g., 30 emails/sec for SendGrid).
- **How?** Workers process messages at a controlled rate, respecting service limits.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Pros**: Prevents service failures, ensures compliance.
  - **Cons**: May delay notifications during high traffic.
- **Reasoning**: Controlled processing avoids hitting rate limits, ensuring reliable delivery.

### **3.4 Retry Mechanisms and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**
- **Why?** External services may fail temporarily, requiring retries.
- **How?** Implement exponential backoff and move failed messages to a DLQ after max retries.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Pros**: Ensures delivery attempts, logs failures for review.
  - **Cons**: Adds complexity, requires manual DLQ intervention.
- **Reasoning**: Exponential backoff prevents infinite loops, and DLQs provide a fallback for manual recovery.

**Exponential Backoff Example**:
```javascript
class RetryHandler {
    async processWithBackoff(job, maxRetries = 10) {
        const baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second
        for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
            try {
                await this.sendNotification(job.data);
                return;
            } catch (error) {
                if (attempt === maxRetries) {
                    await deadLetterQueue.add(job.data);
                    return;
                }
                const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1);
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **3.5 User Preferences and Contextual Delivery**
- **Why?** Avoid spamming users with irrelevant notifications.
- **How?** Check user preferences, online status, and message priority before delivery.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Pros**: Improves user experience, reduces churn.
  - **Cons**: Adds latency and complexity to decision-making.
- **Reasoning**: Context-aware delivery ensures notifications are relevant and timely, enhancing user satisfaction.

**Example Decision Logic**:
```javascript
class NotificationOrchestrator {
    async shouldDeliver(userId, eventType, channel) {
        const [isOnline, preferences, priority] = await Promise.all([
            this.checkOnlineStatus(userId),
            this.checkPreferences(userId, eventType, channel),
            this.checkPriority(eventType)
        ]);
        
        return !isOnline && preferences.enabled && priority > 0;
    }
    
    async checkOnlineStatus(userId) {
        const lastActive = await redis.get(`user:${userId}:last_active`);
        return Date.now() - lastActive < 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
    }
}
```

### **3.6 Ingestion Pipeline**
- **Why?** Filters and prioritizes notifications to avoid overwhelming users.
- **How?** Use a decision engine to evaluate user state, preferences, and message context.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Pros**: Prevents spam, improves UX.
  - **Cons**: Requires additional compute and storage (e.g., Redis for online status).
- **Reasoning**: Ingestion ensures only relevant notifications are sent, respecting user context.

```

### **4.2 Key Components**
| Component | Purpose | Technology Examples |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes user requests | AWS ELB, Nginx |
| **Web Servers** | Handle user actions, publish events | Node.js, Spring Boot |
| **SNS (Pub/Sub)** | Routes events to queues | AWS SNS, Kafka |
| **SQS (Queues)** | Buffer notifications | AWS SQS, RabbitMQ |
| **Workers** | Process notifications | AWS EC2, Lambda |
| **Email Service** | Sends emails | AWS SES, SendGrid |
| **Push Service** | Sends push notifications | Firebase FCM, APNs |
| **In-App Service** | Delivers in-app alerts | WebSocket, Server-Sent Events |
| **Redis** | Stores user state (online/offline) | Redis, Memcached |
| **DLQ** | Stores failed messages | AWS SQS DLQ |
| **Monitoring** | Tracks performance and failures | Prometheus, CloudWatch |

### **4.3 Workflow**
1. **User Action**: User signs up, logs in, or sends a friend request.
2. **Event Publishing**: Web server publishes an event to SNS (e.g., `user.signup`).
3. **Event Routing**: SNS routes the event to relevant queues based on subscriptions.
4. **Queue Processing**: Workers process messages, respecting rate limits and user preferences.
5. **Delivery**: Notifications are sent via email, push, or in-app channels.
6. **Retry & DLQ**: Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff; persistent failures go to DLQ.
7. **Monitoring**: Metrics are logged for performance and failure analysis.

---

## **5. Implementation Details**

### **5.1 Event Publishing**
**Code Example**:
```javascript
const sns = new AWS.SNS();

class EventPublisher {
    async publishEvent(eventType, data) {
        await sns.publish({
            TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:region:account:user-events',
            Message: JSON.stringify({ eventType, ...data }),
            MessageAttributes: {
                eventType: { DataType: 'String', StringValue: eventType }
            }
        }).promise();
    }
}

// Usage in signup route
app.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
    const { firstName, email, password } = req.body;
    const user = await db.users.create({ firstName, email, password });
    
    await new EventPublisher().publishEvent('user.signup', {
        userId: user.id,
        email,
        firstName
    });
    
    res.json({ success: true });
});
```

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Decoupled, reusable across routes.
- **Cons**: Adds latency for SNS publish (minimal, ~10ms).

**Reasoning**: Publishing to SNS ensures loose coupling and enables dynamic routing.

### **5.2 Worker Processing with Rate Limiting**
**Code Example**:
```javascript
const emailQueue = new Queue('email-queue');

class EmailWorker {
    constructor() {
        this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({ email: 25 }); // 25/sec vs 30 limit
    }
    
    async process(job) {
        const { userId, email, message } = job.data;
        
        // Check user preferences and online status
        const canDeliver = await notificationOrchestrator.shouldDeliver(userId, 'user.signup', 'email');
        if (!canDeliver) return;
        
        // Check rate limit
        const canProceed = await this.rateLimiter.checkLimit('email', userId);
        if (!canProceed) {
            await job.retry({ delay: 2000 });
            return;
        }
        
        // Send email
        try {
            await sendEmail(email, message);
            await NotificationMetrics.trackSuccess(job.data, Date.now() - job.timestamp);
        } catch (error) {
            await NotificationMetrics.trackFailure(job.data, error);
            if (job.attemptsMade < 10) {
                const delay = 1000 * Math.pow(2, job.attemptsMade);
                await job.retry({ delay });
            } else {
                await deadLetterQueue.add({ ...job.data, failureReason: error.message });
            }
        }
    }
}

emailQueue.process(25, EmailWorker.prototype.process); // 25 concurrent jobs
```

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Respects rate limits, ensures retries, logs failures.
- **Cons**: Requires careful tuning of concurrency and backoff delays.

**Reasoning**: Controlled concurrency and exponential backoff ensure reliability without overwhelming external services.

### **5.3 Notification Orchestration**
**Code Example**:
```javascript
class NotificationOrchestrator {
    async shouldDeliver(userId, eventType, channel) {
        const [onlineStatus, preferences, priority] = await Promise.all([
            this.checkOnlineStatus(userId),
            this.checkPreferences(userId, eventType, channel),
            this.checkPriority(eventType)
        ]);
        
        if (onlineStatus.isOnline && channel === 'email') {
            return { shouldDeliver: false, reason: 'user_online' };
        }
        if (!preferences.enabled) {
            return { shouldDeliver: false, reason: 'user_opted_out' };
        }
        if (priority < 1) {
            return { shouldDeliver: false, reason: 'low_priority' };
        }
        
        return { shouldDeliver: true };
    }
    
    async checkOnlineStatus(userId) {
        const lastActive = await redis.get(`user:${userId}:last_active`);
        return { isOnline: Date.now() - lastActive < 5 * 60 * 1000 };
    }
    
    async checkPreferences(userId, eventType, channel) {
        const prefs = await db.notificationPreferences.find({ userId });
        return { enabled: prefs[channel]?.[eventType] !== false };
    }
    
    async checkPriority(eventType) {
        const priorities = {
            'user.signup': 2,
            'friend.request': 3,
            'user.post': 1
        };
        return priorities[eventType] || 0;
    }
}
```

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Prevents spam, respects user context.
- **Cons**: Adds latency for checks, requires Redis/db queries.

**Reasoning**: Orchestration ensures notifications are relevant, reducing user annoyance and churn.

### **5.4 Monitoring and Metrics**
**Code Example**:
```javascript
class NotificationMetrics {
    static async trackDelivery(job) {
        await prometheus.increment('notification_attempts', 1, {
            channel: job.data.channel,
            eventType: job.data.eventType
        });
    }
    
    static async trackSuccess(job, latency) {
        await prometheus.histogram('notification_latency_ms', latency, {
            channel: job.data.channel,
            status: 'success'
        });
    }
    
    static async trackFailure(job, error) {
        await prometheus.increment('notification_failures', 1, {
            channel: job.data.channel,
            errorType: error.name
        });
    }
}
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- Notification attempts, successes, and failures.
- Delivery latency per channel.
- Queue depth and DLQ growth.
- Rate limit violations.

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Enables proactive issue detection and optimization.
- **Cons**: Adds overhead for metrics collection and storage.

**Reasoning**: Comprehensive monitoring is critical for ensuring reliability and diagnosing issues.

## **6. Trade-Offs and Engineering Considerations**

### **6.1 Latency vs. Reliability**
- **Latency**: Synchronous calls are fast for low traffic but fail under load or external downtime.
- **Reliability**: Async queues with retries ensure delivery but add processing delays.
- **Mitigation**: Use fast queues (SQS) and optimize worker concurrency.

### **6.2 Scalability vs. Complexity**
- **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture with SNS/SQS scales to millions of notifications.
- **Complexity**: Managing queues, workers, and subscriptions adds operational overhead.
- **Mitigation**: Use managed services (AWS, Kafka) and automate scaling.

### **6.3 User Experience vs. Delivery Volume**
- **User Experience**: Context-aware delivery (e.g., no emails when online) improves UX.
- **Delivery Volume**: Sending all notifications maximizes reach but risks spamming.
- **Mitigation**: Implement ingestion pipeline with user preferences and priority checks.

### **6.4 Cost vs. Performance**
- **Cost**: Queues, workers, and external services (SES, Firebase) incur costs.
- **Performance**: More workers and faster queues improve delivery speed.
- **Mitigation**: Use auto-scaling, spot instances, and cost-effective services like SES.

---

## **7. Real-World Challenges and Solutions**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **External Service Downtime** | Exponential backoff, DLQ, manual reprocessing |
| **Rate Limiting** | Queue-based throttling, conservative rate limits (e.g., 25/sec vs. 30) |
| **User Preferences** | Redis for online status, database for preference storage |
| **Channel Overlap** | Ingestion pipeline to prioritize channels (e.g., in-app over email when online) |
| **Scalability** | Auto-scaling workers, multi-region queues |
| **Delivery Guarantees** | At-least-once delivery with deduplication |

---

## **8. Advanced Features**

### **8.1 Smart Batching**
Group low-priority notifications (e.g., chat summaries) to reduce spam.

**Example**:
```javascript
class NotificationBatcher {
    async batchMessages(userId, messages) {
        if (messages.length < 10) return; // Wait for more messages
        
        const summary = await aiService.summarizeMessages(messages);
        await notificationService.send(userId, 'chat.summary', {
            channel: 'email',
            message: `You have ${messages.length} new messages: ${summary}`
        });
    }
}
```

### **8.2 Priority-Based Delivery**
Assign priorities to events (e.g., OTP = 3, post = 1) and deliver high-priority notifications first.

### **8.3 Cross-Channel Escalation**
If a user doesn’t respond to an in-app notification, escalate to push, then email, then SMS.

**Example**:
```javascript
class EscalationEngine {
    async escalateNotification(userId, eventType, data) {
        const channels = ['in-app', 'push', 'email', 'sms'];
        for (const channel of channels) {
            const delivered = await notificationService.send(userId, eventType, { ...data, channel });
            if (delivered) return;
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5 * 60 * 1000)); // Wait 5 minutes
        }
    }
}

## **9. Third-Party Solutions**

### **9.1 Why Use Third-Party Services?**
- **Simplified Setup**: Handle queues, retries, and channels out of the box.
- **Scalability**: Built for high throughput.
- **Maintenance**: Reduces engineering effort.

**Examples**:
- **Novu**: Open-source, supports multi-channel delivery and ingestion pipelines.
- **Courier**: Closed-source, provides advanced orchestration and analytics.

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Pros**: Fast deployment, robust features.
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, cost for closed-source solutions.

**Reasoning**: Third-party services like Novu or Courier are ideal for startups but may not suit enterprises needing custom logic or cost control.

**Implementation with Novu**:
```javascript
const Novu = require('@novu/node');
const novu = new Novu('YOUR_API_KEY');

async function sendNotification(userId, eventType, data) {
    await novu.trigger(eventType, {
        to: { subscriberId: userId },
        payload: data
    });
}
```

## **10. Key Takeaways**

- **Start Simple**: Use queues for async processing to decouple notifications from core flows.
- **Scale Smart**: Event-driven architecture with pub/sub enables multi-channel support.
- **Handle Failures**: Exponential backoff and DLQs ensure reliable delivery.
- **Respect Users**: Ingestion pipelines prevent spam by checking preferences and context.
- **Monitor Everything**: Track metrics for attempts, successes, failures, and latency.
- **Consider Third-Party**: Services like Novu or Courier simplify implementation for startups.

### **When to Use What**:
- **Small Scale**: Simple queue with workers (e.g., SQS + EC2).
- **Medium Scale**: Event-driven with SNS/SQS for multiple channels.
- **Large Scale**: Full orchestration with ingestion and priority-based delivery.
- **Enterprise**: Custom pipelines or third-party services with advanced features.

This HLD provides a robust framework for building a scalable notification system, addressing core challenges and enabling future growth. For further exploration, consider diving into advanced topics like AI-driven personalization or cross-channel escalation strategies.

I assume you meant "architecture design" for the notification system described in the provided HLD and video transcript. Since you requested a design, I’ll interpret this as creating a **visual architecture diagram** for the notification system in a structured, professional format. However, as I cannot generate or display images directly, I’ll describe the architecture diagram in detail and provide a textual representation using ASCII art to illustrate the components and their interactions. This diagram will align with the HLD’s event-driven, scalable notification system design, incorporating AWS services (SNS, SQS, SES, etc.) and key concepts like queues, workers, and the ingestion pipeline.

If you meant something else by “articture deign” (e.g., a different type of design or an actual image), please clarify, and I can adjust the response. Additionally, since you didn’t explicitly request a chart, I won’t generate a Chart.js JSON config unless you confirm a need for a specific visualization (e.g., a graph of notification metrics).

## **Architecture Diagram for Notification System**

### **Description of the Diagram**
The architecture diagram represents a scalable, event-driven notification system that supports multiple channels (email, push, in-app) with features like rate limiting, retries, user preference management, and monitoring. It follows the fan-out architecture described in the HLD, leveraging AWS services for reliability and scalability. The diagram includes:

1. **Users**: Represented as the starting point, interacting with the system via web or mobile apps.
2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests to web servers.
3. **Web Servers**: Handle user actions (e.g., signup, login) and publish events to SNS.
4. **Database**: Stores user data and notification preferences.
5. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Acts as the pub/sub layer, routing events to multiple queues.
6. **SQS Queues**: Separate queues for email, push, and in-app notifications, each with a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
7. **Workers**: Process messages from queues, respecting rate limits and user preferences.
8. **External Services**: Deliver notifications (e.g., SES for email, Firebase for push, WebSocket for in-app).
9. **Redis**: Caches user online/offline status for ingestion decisions.
10. **Monitoring**: Tracks metrics and logs failures (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch).

### **ASCII Art Representation**

Below is a textual (ASCII) representation of the architecture diagram to visualize the flow and components:

### **How to Create a Professional Diagram**
To create a professional visual diagram based on this design, you can use tools like:
- **Lucidchart**: For clean, cloud-based architecture diagrams.
- **Draw.io**: Free tool integrated with cloud storage.
- **AWS Architecture Icons**: Use official AWS icons for SNS, SQS, SES, etc.
- **Miro**: For collaborative diagramming.
- **Excalidraw**: For quick, hand-drawn-style diagrams.

**Steps to Create**:
1. **Add Components**: Use icons for users, load balancer, web servers, database, SNS, SQS, workers, external services, Redis, and monitoring.
2. **Connect with Arrows**: Show data flow from users to load balancer, web servers to SNS, SNS to queues, and queues to workers and services.
3. **Label Connections**: Indicate event types (e.g., `user.signup`), queue names, and DLQs.
4. **Highlight Fan-Out**: Emphasize SNS distributing to multiple queues.
5. **Include Annotations**: Add notes for rate limiting, retries, and ingestion logic.
6. **Use Colors**: Differentiate components (e.g., blue for AWS services, red for Redis, green for monitoring).

**Example Tools and Resources**:
- AWS Architecture Center: Provides official icons and templates.
- Lucidchart AWS Template: Pre-built AWS component library.
- Draw.io AWS Stencils: Free AWS shapes for diagramming.
