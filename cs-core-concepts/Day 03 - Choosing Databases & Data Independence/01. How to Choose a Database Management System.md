# **Day 3 – Choosing Databases & Data Independence**

## **Article 1: How to Choose a Database Management System**


### **1. Overview**

Choosing the right **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a key architectural decision that impacts:

* Data consistency
* Performance
* Scalability
* Maintainability
* Cost

**Goal:** Select a database based on **system requirements**, not just popularity.

---

### **2. Core Considerations for Database Selection**

1. **Scalability:**

   * Vertical scaling → add resources to one machine (common in relational DBs)
   * Horizontal scaling → add more machines (common in NoSQL DBs)

2. **Data Consistency:**

   * Strict ACID compliance → relational databases
   * Eventual consistency for better availability/performance → NoSQL

3. **Query Patterns & Workload:**

   * Read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced?
   * Complex joins/reporting → RDBMS
   * Key-based lookups/document retrieval → NoSQL

4. **Operational Complexity:**

   * Managed DBs simplify backups, failover, upgrades

5. **System Resilience:**

   * Consider uptime requirements, multi-region support

6. **Performance Needs:**

   * Low latency, high throughput, or both? Choose DB accordingly

### **3. Types of Databases**

1. **Relational Database (RDBMS)**

   * Structured data in rows & columns
   * SQL for queries
   * Ensures integrity with constraints & relationships
   * **Managed RDBMS preferred when:** High availability, automatic backups, security & compliance, scalability, monitoring
   * **Avoid if:** Full control needed or regulatory constraints prevent cloud use
   * **Examples:** Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database

2. **Document Database (NoSQL)**

   * Stores semi-structured data (JSON/BSON)
   * Flexible schema, ideal for hierarchical data
   * **Managed Document DB preferred when:** Schema evolves, team lacks admin skills, global distribution needed, auto-scaling required
   * **Avoid if:** Need fine-tuned internal control, on-premise hosting required
   * **Examples:** MongoDB Atlas, Amazon DocumentDB, Couchbase Capella

3. **Key-Value Stores**

   * Stores data as key-value pairs
   * Optimized for speed and simplicity
   * **Managed preferred when:** Low latency, high throughput, automatic scaling, failover handled by provider
   * **Avoid if:** Custom memory management needed, on-prem deployment required
   * **Examples:** Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached), Azure Cache for Redis

4. **Time-Series Databases**

   * Handles timestamp-indexed data (metrics, logs)
   * **Managed preferred when:** IoT, analytics, dashboards, high-throughput ingestion
   * **Avoid if:** Tight on-prem integration required
   * **Examples:** InfluxDB Cloud, Amazon Timestream, Azure Data Explorer

5. **Columnar Databases**

   * Stores data by columns, optimized for analytical queries
   * **Managed preferred when:** OLAP, BI, big data, elasticity needed
   * **Avoid if:** Budget constraints, custom storage/compression needed
   * **Examples:** Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake

6. **Graph Databases**

   * Models data as nodes and relationships
   * **Managed preferred when:** Complex relationships (social networks, recommendations), team lacks optimization skills, high availability needed
   * **Avoid if:** High customization of graph engine required
   * **Examples:** Neo4j Aura, Amazon Neptune, Azure Cosmos DB

---

### **4. Managed Databases**

* Cloud-based DB where **maintenance, scaling, backups, patching** are handled by the provider
* Available for all DB types: RDBMS, Document, Key-Value, Time-Series, Columnar, Graph
* Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Cosmos DB, MongoDB Atlas

---

### **5. Architecture Patterns Affecting Database Choice**

1. **Polyglot Persistence:** Use multiple DBs for different purposes
2. **CQRS:** Separate DBs for writes and reads
3. **Event Sourcing:** Store state changes as events
4. **Microservices:** Each service manages its own database

**Key Tips:**

* Design for failure: backups & replication
* Plan schema evolution
* Prefer managed services if operations are complex
* Ensure monitoring: query speed, errors, replication, performance
