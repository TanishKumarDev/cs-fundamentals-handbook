# **Day 16 – Characteristics of SQL**

---

## **1. Standardized Language**

* SQL provides a **consistent way to query databases** across platforms.
* Syntax and functionality are **almost the same** in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
* This makes it easy to **learn once and use anywhere**.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

* The query defines the table structure without worrying about the underlying DBMS mechanics.

---

## **2. Declarative Language**

* SQL is **declarative**: you specify *what data you want*, not *how to retrieve it*.
* You focus on the **result**, not the algorithm.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT name, department 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

* You get all employees from Sales without specifying search logic.

---

## **3. Data Definition and Manipulation**

SQL supports both **structure definition** and **data handling**:

### **Data Definition Language (DDL)**

* Commands: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
* Used to **define and modify tables and schemas**.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

* Commands: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`
* Used to **add, update, delete, and retrieve data**.

**Example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department) 
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Sales');
```

---

## **4. Portability of Applications**

* SQL allows **easy transfer of database applications** across systems.
* Example: A MySQL database on Windows can move to PostgreSQL on Linux with minimal changes.

---

## **5. Common Language for Professionals**

* SQL is standardized, enabling **clear communication** among DB professionals.
* Reduces training costs and ensures a **unified skillset** across platforms.

---

## **6. Increased Productivity**

* SQL **simplifies complex operations** like querying, updating, and managing data.
* Professionals can **analyze and act faster** with SQL skills.

---

## **7. Longevity of SQL**

* SQL has been around for decades and is **still crucial** in modern database systems.
* Learning SQL is a **long-term skill** with career value.

---

## **8. Vendor Independence**

* Most databases follow SQL standards, with minor variations.
* Businesses can **switch DB vendors** without rewriting applications.

## **9. Rules for Writing SQL Commands**

| Rule                                         | Explanation                         | Example                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Table Name Restrictions**                  | Max 20 characters, unique within DB | `CREATE TABLE employees (...);`     |
| **Field Name Restrictions**                  | Each column name must be unique     | `name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE`           |
| **Parentheses for Field List and Length**    | Required for syntax                 | `salary DECIMAL(10,2)`              |
| **Specifying Field Type and Length**         | Always define data type and length  | `date_of_joining DATE`              |
| **Separating Field Definitions with Commas** | Required for multiple fields        | `employee_id INT, name VARCHAR(50)` |
| **Ending Statements with Semicolon**         | Signals end of SQL command          | `SELECT * FROM employees;`          |

### ✅ **Quick Takeaways**

1. SQL is **standardized, declarative, and portable**.
2. Supports **DDL & DML** for structure and data operations.
3. **Rules** exist to maintain syntax correctness and avoid conflicts.
4. SQL is a **long-term, essential skill** for database professionals.
