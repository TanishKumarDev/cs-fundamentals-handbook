# **Round Robin Scheduling (OS)**

**Definition:**
Round Robin Scheduling is a **preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm** where each process is assigned a **fixed time quantum**. The CPU cycles through the ready queue, giving each process equal CPU time in turns.

**Key Points:**

* Promotes fairness.
* Ideal for **time-sharing systems**.
* Each process executes for **maximum of time quantum**; if not finished, it returns to the end of the queue.

---

## **Algorithm Steps**

1. Processes enter the ready queue based on their **arrival time**.
2. Assign a **time quantum** for execution.
3. Execute the **first process** in the queue for 1 quantum or until it finishes.
4. If unfinished, move it to the **end of the queue**.
5. Add newly arrived processes to the queue.
6. Repeat until all processes complete.
7. Calculate **TAT** and **WT**:

   * `TAT = CT - AT`
   * `WT = TAT - BT`

## **Example 1: Same Arrival Time**

| Process | AT | BT | Time Quantum = 2 |
| ------- | -- | -- | ---------------- |
| P1      | 0  | 4  |                  |
| P2      | 0  | 5  |                  |
| P3      | 0  | 3  |                  |

**Execution (Step by Step):**

| Time  | Process | Remaining BT |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| 0-2   | P1      | 2            |
| 2-4   | P2      | 3            |
| 4-6   | P3      | 1            |
| 6-8   | P1      | 0            |
| 8-10  | P2      | 1            |
| 10-11 | P3      | 0            |
| 11-12 | P2      | 0            |

**Calculations:**

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P1      | 8  | 8             | 4             |
| P2      | 12 | 12            | 7             |
| P3      | 11 | 11            | 8             |

* **Average TAT** = 10.33 ms
* **Average WT** = 6.33 ms

## **Example 2: Different Arrival Times**

| Process | AT | BT | Time Quantum = 2 |
| ------- | -- | -- | ---------------- |
| P1      | 0  | 5  |                  |
| P2      | 4  | 2  |                  |
| P3      | 5  | 4  |                  |

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **0-2:** P1 executes → remaining BT = 3
2. **2-4:** P1 executes again → remaining BT = 1
3. **4-6:** P2 executes (arrived at 4) → remaining BT = 0
4. **6-7:** P1 executes → remaining BT = 0
5. **7-9:** P3 executes → remaining BT = 2
6. **9-11:** P3 executes → remaining BT = 0

**Calculations:**

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P1      | 7  | 7             | 2             |
| P2      | 6  | 2             | 0             |
| P3      | 11 | 6             | 2             |

* **Average TAT** = 5 ms
* **Average WT** = 1.33 ms

## **Advantages of Round Robin**

1. **Fairness:** Each process gets equal CPU time.
2. **Simplicity:** Easy to implement.
3. **Responsiveness:** Good for time-sharing systems.

## **Disadvantages of Round Robin**

1. **Overhead:** Frequent context switching if quantum is too small.
2. **Underutilization:** Large quantum may delay other processes.
