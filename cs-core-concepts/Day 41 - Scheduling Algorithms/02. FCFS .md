# **FCFS (First Come, First Serve) CPU Scheduling**

**Definition**:
FCFS is a **non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm** where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. Once a process starts, it runs until it finishes or performs I/O.

---

## **How FCFS Works**

1. **Arrival**: Processes enter the ready queue in the order they arrive.
2. **Execution**: CPU selects the first process in the queue and runs it to completion.
3. **Repeat**: Next process in the queue executes, continuing until all processes are finished.

## **Example 1: Processes with Same Arrival Time**

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 0                 | 5               |
| P2      | 0                 | 3               |
| P3      | 0                 | 8               |

**Execution Timeline (Gantt Chart)**:

```
P1 | P2 | P3
0  5   8  16
```

**Calculations**:

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P1      | 5  | 5             | 0             |
| P2      | 8  | 8             | 5             |
| P3      | 16 | 16            | 8             |

* **Average Turnaround Time (TAT)** = (5 + 8 + 16) / 3 = 9.67
* **Average Waiting Time (WT)** = (0 + 5 + 8) / 3 = 4.33

## **Example 2: Processes with Different Arrival Times**

| Process | BT | AT |
| ------- | -- | -- |
| P1      | 5  | 2  |
| P2      | 3  | 0  |
| P3      | 4  | 4  |

**Execution Timeline (Gantt Chart)**:

```
P2 | P1 | P3
0  3   8  12
```

**Calculations**:

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P2      | 3  | 3             | 0             |
| P1      | 8  | 6             | 1             |
| P3      | 12 | 8             | 4             |

* **Average TAT** = (3 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 5.67
* **Average WT** = (0 + 1 + 4) / 3 = 1.67

## **Advantages of FCFS**

1. Simple and easy to implement.
2. Fair: every process gets a chance in the order of arrival.
3. No starvation; processes are executed sequentially.
4. Good for **batch systems**.

---

## **Disadvantages of FCFS**

1. **Convoy effect**: Long processes delay shorter ones.
2. High average waiting time compared to other algorithms.
3. Poor performance for time-sharing systems.
4. Processes at the end of the queue wait longer.
