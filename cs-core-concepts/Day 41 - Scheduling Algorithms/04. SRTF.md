# **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling**

**Definition:**
SRTF is the **preemptive version of SJF**. At every time unit, the CPU executes the process that has the **smallest remaining burst time**. If a new process arrives with a smaller remaining time than the currently running process, the CPU **preempts** the running process.

> Ensures that the **fastest finishing process always gets priority**, minimizing average waiting time.

---

## **Characteristics of SRTF**

1. **Preemptive:** Can interrupt a running process if a shorter job arrives.
2. **Reduces waiting time:** Short processes finish quickly.
3. **Starvation possible:** Long processes can be delayed indefinitely.
4. **High context-switch overhead:** Frequent preemption can reduce efficiency.
5. **Not ideal for real-time systems** due to unpredictability.

## **Example 1: Same Arrival Time**

| Process | AT | BT |
| ------- | -- | -- |
| P1      | 0  | 6  |
| P2      | 0  | 8  |
| P3      | 0  | 5  |

**Execution:**

* Time 0–5: P3 (shortest remaining)
* Time 5–11: P1
* Time 11–19: P2

**Gantt Chart:**

```
P3 | P1 | P2
0   5   11  19
```

**Calculations:**

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P1      | 11 | 11            | 5             |
| P2      | 19 | 19            | 11            |
| P3      | 5  | 5             | 0             |

* **Average TAT** = 11.6 ms
* **Average WT** = 5.33 ms

## **Example 2: Different Arrival Times**

| Process | AT | BT |
| ------- | -- | -- |
| P1      | 0  | 6  |
| P2      | 1  | 3  |
| P3      | 2  | 7  |

**Execution:**

* Time 0–1: P1 (runs 1 unit)
* Time 1–4: P2 (shortest remaining)
* Time 4–9: P1 (remaining 5 units)
* Time 9–16: P3

**Gantt Chart:**

```
P1 | P2 | P1 | P3
0   1   4   9   16
```

**Calculations:**

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P1      | 9  | 9             | 3             |
| P2      | 4  | 3             | 0             |
| P3      | 16 | 14            | 7             |

* **Average TAT** = 8.6 ms
* **Average WT** = 3.33 ms

## **Steps for Implementing SRTF**

1. Input number of processes, burst times, and arrival times.
2. Initialize **remaining times = burst times**.
3. Start current time = 0, completed = 0.
4. At each time unit:

   * Add arrived processes to **ready queue**.
   * Pick the process with **shortest remaining time**.
   * Execute **1 unit of time** and decrement remaining time.
5. If a process completes:

   * `CT = current time`
   * `TAT = CT - AT`
   * `WT = TAT - BT`
6. Repeat until all processes are completed.
7. Calculate **average TAT and WT**.

## **Advantages of SRTF**

1. **Minimizes average waiting time**.
2. **Short processes complete quickly**, improving responsiveness.
3. **Good for time-critical tasks** in non-real-time systems.

## **Disadvantages of SRTF**

1. **Starvation of long processes**.
2. **Difficult to predict burst times** accurately.
3. **High context-switching overhead**.
4. **Not suitable for real-time systems**.
