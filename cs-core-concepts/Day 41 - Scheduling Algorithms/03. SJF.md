# **Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling**

**Definition:**
SJF is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the **process with the smallest burst time** to execute next. It can be **preemptive** (Shortest Remaining Time First, SRTF) or **non-preemptive**.

> The main advantage of SJF is **minimizing average waiting time** for all processes.

## **Characteristics of SJF**

1. Chooses the process with **minimum CPU burst time** next.
2. Can be **preemptive or non-preemptive**:

   * **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts, it runs to completion.
   * **Preemptive (SRTF)**: If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time, it preempts the running process.
3. **Starvation is possible** for long processes if short jobs keep arriving (solved via **aging**).
4. **Optimal** in terms of **average waiting time** among all non-preemptive algorithms.

## **Burst Time Estimation (for unknown CPU bursts)**

Sometimes the exact burst time is unknown. It can be estimated using:

[
T_{n+1} = \alpha \cdot t_n + (1-\alpha) \cdot T_n
]

Where:

* (T_{n+1}) = Predicted burst time for the next process
* (t_n) = Actual burst time of previous process
* (T_n) = Previously predicted burst time
* (\alpha) = Smoothing factor (0 ≤ α ≤ 1)

## **Example: Non-Preemptive SJF**

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 0                 | 6               |
| P2      | 2                 | 8               |
| P3      | 4                 | 3               |

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Time 0-6:** P1 runs (first arrival).
2. **Time 6-9:** P3 runs (shortest remaining burst at time 6).
3. **Time 9-17:** P2 runs (remaining process).

**Gantt Chart:**

```
P1 | P3 | P2
0  6   9  17
```

**Calculations:**

| Process | CT | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
| ------- | -- | ------------- | ------------- |
| P1      | 6  | 6             | 0             |
| P2      | 17 | 15            | 7             |
| P3      | 9  | 5             | 2             |

* **Average Turnaround Time (TAT)** = (6 + 15 + 5)/3 = 8.6
* **Average Waiting Time (WT)** = (0 + 7 + 2)/3 = 3

## **Steps for Implementing SJF (Non-Preemptive)**

1. Input number of processes, their burst times, and arrival times.
2. Sort processes by **burst time** (tie-break with arrival order).
3. Pick the process with **shortest burst time** next.
4. Compute:

   * **Completion Time (CT)** = Start Time + Burst Time
   * **Turnaround Time (TAT)** = CT − AT
   * **Waiting Time (WT)** = TAT − BT
5. Repeat until all processes are completed.
6. Compute **average TAT and WT**.

## **Advantages of SJF**

1. **Reduces average waiting time** compared to FCFS.
2. Efficient for **batch systems**.
3. Optimal for known CPU burst times.

## **Disadvantages of SJF**

1. **Starvation** for long processes if short jobs arrive continuously.
2. Requires **knowledge of burst time** in advance.
3. Difficult to **predict CPU burst length** accurately.
