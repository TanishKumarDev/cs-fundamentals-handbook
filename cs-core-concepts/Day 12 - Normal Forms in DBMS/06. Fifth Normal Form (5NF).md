# **Day 12 ‚Äî Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

### **Definition**

Fifth Normal Form (5NF), also called **Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF)**, ensures that:

1. The table is already in **4NF**.
2. The table **cannot be decomposed further without loss of data**.

**Goal:**

* Eliminate redundancy caused by **join dependencies**.
* Ensure **lossless decomposition**, i.e., the original table can be reconstructed exactly from its decomposed tables.

---

### **Rules**

1. Must satisfy all **4NF conditions**:

   * BCNF satisfied
   * No multivalued dependencies
2. **Non-loss decomposition:**

   * Decomposing tables should allow reconstruction without losing data.
   * Avoid **spurious tuples** (extra unwanted rows after joining tables).

**Join Dependency:**
[
R = (R_1 ;\bowtie; R_2 ;\bowtie; ... ;\bowtie; R_n)
]
Where (R_1, R_2, ..., R_n) are sub-relations of R and (\bowtie) is the **natural join** operator.

### üìò **Example**

**Given Table R:**

| Subject | Class    | Teacher |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| math    | class 10 | kartik  |
| math    | class 9  | yash    |
| math    | class 10 | yash    |
| science | class 10 | yash    |

**Problem:**

* Each subject can be taught by multiple teachers in multiple classes.
* Redundancy exists (e.g., math-class10 appears twice).

**Step 1 ‚Äî Decompose into R1 and R2**

**R1 ‚Äî Subject & Class**

| Subject | Class    |
| ------- | -------- |
| math    | class 9  |
| math    | class 10 |
| science | class 10 |

**R2 ‚Äî Class & Teacher**

| Class    | Teacher |
| -------- | ------- |
| class 10 | kartik  |
| class 9  | yash    |
| class 10 | yash    |

**Step 2 ‚Äî Check for spurious tuples**

* Joining R1 ‚®ù R2 creates extra tuples (spurious data).

**Step 3 ‚Äî Add R3 ‚Äî Subject & Teacher**

| Subject | Teacher |
| ------- | ------- |
| math    | yash    |
| math    | kartik  |
| science | yash    |

**Step 4 ‚Äî Rejoin (R1 ‚®ù R2 ‚®ù R3)**

* Original table is perfectly reconstructed ‚úÖ
* No data loss
* Redundancy removed

**Result:** Tables R1, R2, R3 satisfy **5NF**.

### **Uses of 5NF**

1. Eliminates redundancy completely.
2. Ensures **non-lossy decomposition** ‚Üí data consistency & integrity.
3. Optimized database operations ‚Üí better performance.

---

### **Limitations of 5NF**

1. **High complexity:** Many tables and relations.
2. **Performance overhead:** More joins ‚Üí slower queries.
3. **Implementation cost:** Increased design and maintenance effort.
