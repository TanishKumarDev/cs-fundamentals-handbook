# **Introduction to Operating System**

## **1. What is an Operating System (OS)?**

### **Definition**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250723191540003787/control_flow.webp)

An **Operating System (OS)** is a **software layer** that acts as an **intermediary between the user and computer hardware**.
It ensures that programs execute efficiently and conveniently by managing all system resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

In short, it is the **“manager”** of the computer system — handling resources, security, and communication between hardware and software.

### **Simple Analogy**

Think of an OS as the **“super manager”** or **“referee”** of your computer:

* It controls and coordinates how apps use the CPU, RAM, disk, etc.
* It ensures fair usage of resources.
* It prevents programs from interfering with each other.

### **Technical Definition**

> **"An Operating System is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs."**

## **2. Before Operating Systems**

Before operating systems existed, computers were manually controlled by users. Users acted as the OS — they loaded, ran, and managed their own programs.

### **How It Worked Before OS**

* **No OS existed** — users interacted directly with the hardware.
* **Manual loading:** Programs were loaded via **punch cards or magnetic tapes**.
* **User as operator:** Users scheduled their own runs and waited for completion.
* **Hardware-level programming:** Programs were written in **machine or assembly language**.
* **No multitasking:** Only one program could run at a time.

### **Why OS Emerged**

Operating systems were developed to:

* Automate manual control.
* Manage hardware and resources efficiently.
* Allow **multiple programs** and **multiple users** to work simultaneously.
* Simplify computer usage and improve performance.

## **3. Why Does an OS Exist?**

Imagine your phone without an OS — every app would have to control memory, CPU, and screen directly. Chaos!

### **Problem 1: Resource Chaos**

Without an OS:

* Apps compete for CPU and memory.
* One app (like TikTok) can consume all resources, crashing others.

**With OS:**

* The OS allocates CPU, RAM, and I/O fairly among apps.
* Example: TikTok → 20%, PUBG → 50% CPU.
  → **Both run smoothly.**

**Concept:** The OS ensures **Resource Management** and **Fairness**.

---

### **Problem 2: Complex Applications**

Without an OS:

* Every app must handle memory, CPU scheduling, I/O operations, and device communication.

**Result:** Apps become huge and inefficient.

**With OS:**

* The OS provides built-in functions and APIs.
* Developers can focus on app logic — not hardware control.

**Concept:** The OS follows the **DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**.

---

### **Problem 3: No Security or Isolation**

Without an OS:

* One app can access or corrupt another app’s memory.
* Example: TikTok modifies PUBG’s memory — system crashes.

**With OS:**

* **Memory Protection:** Each app runs in its own space.
* **Process Isolation:** Apps can’t interfere with one another.

**Concept:** The OS ensures **Security** and **Process Isolation**.

---

## **4. How the OS Solves These Problems**

### **A. Resource Manager (The Referee)**

**Role:** Allocates CPU, memory, and devices fairly among processes.

**Mechanism:**

* Uses **scheduling algorithms** to share CPU time.
* Balances resource usage for multiple programs.

**Example:**

| Process | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
| ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| TikTok  | 5%        | 10%          |
| PUBG    | 50%       | 60%          |

---

### **B. Interface (The Middleman)**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250905143719949052/operating_system_diagram.webp)

**Analogy:** A **bank teller** between you and the vault.
You don’t touch the vault directly — the teller handles it.

Similarly, apps don’t access hardware directly; they use the OS as an interface.

**Example in C++:**

```cpp
int* arr = new int[10]; 
// The OS finds free memory; the program doesn’t worry where it comes from.
```

---

### **C. Abstraction (Hiding Complexity)**

**Definition:** The OS hides hardware details behind simple interfaces.

**Why:** So developers don’t have to deal with:

* Which RAM sector is free
* How to communicate with the GPU
* How to control I/O devices

**Example:**
You write `cout << "Hello";`
→ OS converts it into screen pixels automatically.

---

### **D. Protection (The Bodyguard)**

**Purpose:** To prevent apps from interfering or harming each other.

**Mechanisms:**

1. **Memory Isolation:** Each app has its own space.
2. **Permissions:** OS controls access to files, memory, and devices.

**Example:**
TikTok can’t access PUBG’s memory or camera data directly.

---

## **5. OS in Computer System Hierarchy**

Every general-purpose computer has:

1. **Hardware** – CPU, ALU, memory, I/O, and storage.
2. **Operating System** – Manages resources and hardware access.
3. **System Programs** – Compilers, loaders, editors.
4. **Application Programs** – User-level apps (Word, Chrome, etc.).

The OS always runs in the **background**, coordinating between these layers.

---

## **6. Goals of an Operating System**

### **Primary Goals**

1. **User Convenience:** Make computer usage simple and intuitive.
2. **Program Execution:** Provide an environment for running user programs.
3. **Resource Management:** Allocate CPU, memory, and I/O efficiently.
4. **Security:** Protect user data and maintain integrity and confidentiality.

### **Secondary Goals**

1. **Efficiency:** Maximize performance and utilization of resources.
2. **Reliability:** Handle errors gracefully and ensure system stability.
3. **Modularity:** Easy to debug, maintain, and extend.

---

## **7. Components of an Operating System**

### **1. Kernel (Core Component)**

* The **heart** of the OS.
* Directly interacts with the hardware.
* Responsible for **process**, **memory**, and **device management**.

### **2. Shell (User Interface)**

* The **outer layer** of the OS.
* Allows user interaction through:

  * **Command Line Interface (CLI)** – e.g., Linux terminal.
  * **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – e.g., Windows desktop.

**Note:**
The **Kernel** handles low-level operations,
while the **Shell** provides a user-friendly way to interact with it.

## **Use Cases / Real-world Applications**

* **Mobile OS (Android, iOS)** for smartphones.
* **Server OS (Linux, Unix)** for data centers.
* **Embedded OS** for IoT devices and smart appliances.
* **Desktop OS (Windows, macOS)** for personal and office systems.

---

## **Common Confusions**

* **OS ≠ Kernel**: Kernel is part of OS, not the whole.
* **System Software ≠ Application Software**: OS is system software; browsers, games are applications.
* **CLI ≠ GUI**: Both are user interfaces provided by OS.
