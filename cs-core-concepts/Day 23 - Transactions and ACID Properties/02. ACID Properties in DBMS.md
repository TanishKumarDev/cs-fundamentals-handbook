# **Day 23 – Transactions and ACID Properties**

## **Article 2: ACID Properties in DBMS**

### **1. Overview**

ACID properties define how database transactions must behave to ensure **data integrity, consistency, and reliability**, even in the presence of failures.
Each transaction in DBMS must satisfy four fundamental properties — **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID)** — to maintain correctness and trustworthiness of data.

### **2. Properties of ACID**

#### **A. Atomicity**

* Ensures that a transaction is **all or nothing** — either all its operations succeed or none take effect.
* If any step fails, the entire transaction rolls back, leaving the database unchanged.
* **Commit:** Makes all changes permanent.
* **Rollback/Abort:** Discards partial changes in case of failure.

**Example:**
In a transfer of $100 from account X to account Y —
If the deduction from X succeeds but the addition to Y fails, the transaction rolls back to keep the database consistent.

---

#### **B. Consistency**

* The database must remain in a **valid and rule-compliant state** before and after every transaction.
* All **constraints, rules, and relationships** (like primary key, foreign key, etc.) must hold true after the transaction.

**Example:**
If total bank balance before a transfer is ₹700 (₹500 + ₹200), it must remain ₹700 after transferring ₹100 (₹400 + ₹300).
Any violation of constraints causes rollback to maintain consistency.

---

#### **C. Isolation**

* Ensures that **concurrent transactions execute independently** and do not affect each other’s intermediate results.
* Prevents issues like:

  * **Dirty Reads:** Reading uncommitted data
  * **Non-repeatable Reads:** Data changes between reads
  * **Phantom Reads:** New records appear during a transaction

**Example:**
Two transactions, `T` (transfer $50) and `T''` (calculate total balance), should not interfere.
`T''` must only read the final committed values after `T` completes to ensure consistency.

---

#### **D. Durability**

* Once a transaction is **committed**, its changes are **permanently saved** — even in the case of a crash or system failure.
* Achieved through non-volatile memory and recovery logs.

**Example:**
After a successful money transfer, even if the system crashes, the new balances remain safe on disk due to durability.

### **3. How ACID Properties Impact DBMS Design**

| **Property**    | **Maintained By**           | **Ensures**                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Atomicity**   | Transaction Manager         | All-or-nothing execution          |
| **Consistency** | Application Programmer      | Data validity after transactions  |
| **Isolation**   | Concurrency Control Manager | Independent transaction execution |
| **Durability**  | Recovery System             | Permanent storage of results      |

---

### **4. Importance in DBMS Operation**

#### **a. Data Integrity and Consistency**

* Ensures that the database transitions only between **valid states**.
* Prevents partial or corrupted updates.

#### **b. Concurrency Control**

* Allows safe simultaneous transactions by preventing interference.
* Maintains predictable and accurate outcomes.

#### **c. Recovery and Fault Tolerance**

* Even after crashes, the system can recover to a consistent state.
* Combines **Atomicity** (rollback failed transactions) and **Durability** (preserve committed changes).

---

### **5. Real-World Use Cases**

* **Banking:** Transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers must follow ACID to avoid balance mismatches or loss.
* **E-commerce:** Inventory and order processing require consistent, isolated, and durable updates.
* **Healthcare:** Medical records and prescriptions must maintain strict consistency and durability to ensure accuracy.

---

### **6. Summary**

* ACID ensures that transactions are **atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable**.
* These properties make databases **reliable**, **fault-tolerant**, and **safe for concurrent use**.
* Without ACID compliance, data could become inconsistent or corrupted, especially under high load or system failures.
