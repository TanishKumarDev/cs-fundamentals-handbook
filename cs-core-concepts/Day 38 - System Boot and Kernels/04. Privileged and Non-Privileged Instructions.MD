# **Privileged and Non-Privileged Instructions in Operating System**

---

## **1. Introduction**

In a computer system, the **CPU executes instructions**. These instructions are classified into:

1. **Privileged Instructions** – can only be executed by the **operating system (kernel)**.
2. **Non-Privileged Instructions** – can be executed by **user-level processes**.

This classification **ensures system security, stability, and efficient resource management**.

## **2. Privileged Instructions**

### **Definition**

Privileged instructions are **special CPU instructions that require kernel mode** to execute. They directly interact with **hardware or critical resources**, and **cannot be run in user mode**.

> If attempted in user mode, the hardware **traps the instruction** and signals an error to the OS.

---

### **Examples**

* I/O operations (e.g., accessing disk or printer directly)
* Halt instruction (stop CPU)
* Turning off all interrupts
* Setting the timer
* Context switching
* Clearing memory or removing a process
* Modifying device-status tables

---

### **Role of OS in Privileged Instructions**

1. **Access Control:**

   * Ensures only **authorized processes** can execute privileged instructions.
   * Prevents **malicious or accidental misuse**.

2. **Memory Protection:**

   * Restricts processes from accessing OS memory or other processes’ memory.
   * Prevents crashes and tampering.

3. **Interrupt Handling:**

   * Safely executes system calls or exceptions.
   * Saves process state during interrupts and restores afterward.

4. **Virtualization:**

   * Creates a **simulated environment** for executing privileged instructions without direct hardware access.
   * Ensures **security and isolation**.

---

### **Key Characteristics**

* Executed **only in kernel mode**
* Can **modify hardware or OS state**
* **High risk** if misused (system crashes, vulnerabilities)

---

## **3. Non-Privileged Instructions**

### **Definition**

Non-privileged instructions can be executed by **any process**, typically in **user mode**.
They perform **general-purpose computations** and **user-level operations** without direct hardware control.

---

### **Examples**

* Reading processor status
* Reading system time
* Generating traps or interrupts
* Sending print jobs to a printer

> To switch from privileged to non-privileged mode, a **non-privileged instruction that does not generate an interrupt** is required.

---

### **Key Characteristics**

* Executed in **user mode**
* Access to system resources is **limited**
* **Lower risk** of crashes or security issues
* Used for **general-purpose computing**

## **4. Differences Between Privileged & Non-Privileged Instructions**

| Criteria                 | Privileged Instructions                   | Non-Privileged Instructions          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Access to Resources**  | Direct access to CPU, memory, I/O devices | Limited, mediated by OS              |
| **Execution Mode**       | Kernel mode only                          | User mode                            |
| **Permissions Required** | Yes (special)                             | No                                   |
| **Purpose**              | Perform low-level system operations       | Perform general-purpose computations |
| **Risk**                 | High (can crash system)                   | Low                                  |

## **5. Real-World Analogy**

| Instruction Type | Analogy                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Privileged       | Bank manager controlling the vault access |
| Non-Privileged   | Customer withdrawing money via ATM        |

* **Privileged instructions** = only trusted “managers” can handle them
* **Non-privileged instructions** = regular users with limited access

---

## **6. Key Takeaways**

* Privileged instructions = **kernel-only**, hardware-level operations.
* Non-privileged instructions = **user-level**, safe general operations.
* The **OS enforces the rules** to prevent crashes, security breaches, and resource conflicts.
* Understanding these instructions is crucial for **OS security and stability**.
