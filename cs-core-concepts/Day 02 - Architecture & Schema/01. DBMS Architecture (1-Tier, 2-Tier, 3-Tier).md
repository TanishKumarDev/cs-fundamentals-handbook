# **Day 2 – DBMS Architecture**

## **Article 1: DBMS Architecture (1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier)**



### **1. Overview**

**DBMS Architecture** defines how users interact with a database to **read, write, or update data**.
A well-designed architecture ensures:

* Data consistency and integrity
* Performance optimization
* Secure and organized data access

Architectures are chosen based on **application size, user base, and scalability requirements**.

### **2. 1-Tier Architecture**

* **Definition:** Client, server, and database are all on a **single system**.
* **Example:** Microsoft Excel — data entry, calculations, and storage happen on the same machine.
* **Use Case:** Personal or standalone applications without network dependency.

**Advantages:**

1. Simple architecture — only one machine needed
2. Cost-effective — no additional hardware
3. Easy to implement and deploy

**Disadvantages:**

1. Single-user only — not suitable for multiple users
2. Poor security — all data on one machine
3. No centralized control — hard to manage or back up
4. Difficult data sharing between users

---

### **3. 2-Tier Architecture**

* **Definition:** Follows a **basic client-server model**; the client communicates directly with the database server.
* **Interaction:** APIs like **ODBC** or **JDBC** are used.
* **Example:** Library Management System (small schools or organizations).

**Layers:**

1. **Client Layer (Tier 1):** User interface and application logic
2. **Database Layer (Tier 2):** Database server stores records and handles queries

**Advantages:**

1. Easy database access and fast retrieval
2. Scalable by adding clients or upgrading hardware
3. Cost-effective and easy to deploy
4. Simple to understand and implement

**Disadvantages:**

1. Limited scalability — server overload with many users
2. Security issues — clients connect directly to the database
3. Tight coupling — client may need updates if the database changes
4. Difficult maintenance with more users

---

### **4. 3-Tier Architecture**

* **Definition:** Adds an **application server layer** between client and database. Client communicates only with the application server.
* **Example:** E-commerce store — client interacts with app server, which communicates with database for product, cart, and order management.

**Advantages:**

1. Enhanced scalability — distributed deployment of app servers
2. Maintains data integrity — prevents corruption via middle layer
3. Improved security — client does not access database directly

**Disadvantages:**

1. More complex setup than 2-Tier architecture
2. Interaction slower due to extra layer
3. Higher cost — additional hardware, software, and skilled personnel required

### **5. Summary**

| Architecture | Description                                             | Advantages                               | Disadvantages                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-Tier**   | Single system with client, server, database             | Simple, cost-effective, easy to deploy   | Single-user, poor security, hard to share data       |
| **2-Tier**   | Client-server model, direct client-server communication | Easy access, scalable, simple deployment | Limited scalability, security issues, tight coupling |
| **3-Tier**   | Client → Application Server → Database Server           | Scalable, secure, maintains integrity    | Complex, slower response, higher cost                |

**Key Takeaway:**

* **1-Tier:** Best for personal, standalone applications
* **2-Tier:** Suitable for small-to-medium organizations
* **3-Tier:** Ideal for large-scale web applications requiring security, scalability, and multi-user access
