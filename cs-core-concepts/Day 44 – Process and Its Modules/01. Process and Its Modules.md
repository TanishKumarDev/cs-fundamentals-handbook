# **Day 44 – Process and Its Modules**

---

## **1. Introduction**

In an **Operating System**, a **process** is a **program in execution**.
It contains everything required for that program to run — code, data, resources, and state.

But a process is **not just the code** — it’s divided into **logical modules (segments)** that help the OS manage and execute it efficiently.

Understanding these **modules of a process** is essential for topics like scheduling, memory management, and context switching.

---

## **2. What is a Process Module?**

A **process module** (or **process segment**) is a specific part of a process’s **memory layout** that holds a particular type of data or instruction.

When a process is loaded into main memory, it’s divided into 4–5 major modules.

---

## **3. Components / Modules of a Process**

Let’s explore each module in detail:

| Module                             | Description                                                          | Type of Memory   | Example                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **1. Text Section (Code Segment)** | Contains compiled machine instructions                               | Read-only        | `int main() {}`                 |
| **2. Data Section**                | Holds **global** and **static** variables                            | Read/Write       | `int x = 10; static int y = 5;` |
| **3. Heap**                        | Dynamically allocated memory at runtime                              | Expands upward   | `malloc(), new`                 |
| **4. Stack**                       | Stores **function calls**, **local variables**, **return addresses** | Expands downward | Function call stack             |
| **5. PCB (Process Control Block)** | Stores process info (state, registers, etc.)                         | OS-managed       | Process metadata                |

## **4. Why Divide a Process into Modules?**

### **Reasons:**

1. **Efficient Memory Management** – Different segments can grow/shrink dynamically.
2. **Protection & Security** – Prevents code modification at runtime.
3. **Easy Context Switching** – OS only saves necessary parts.
4. **Simplified Debugging & Linking** – Modules map to different binary sections.
5. **Scalability** – Supports dynamic memory and recursion efficiently.

---

## **5. Example Program Demonstrating Process Modules**

Let’s see a simple C++ example that touches all the modules.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int globalVar = 10;          // Data segment
static int staticVar = 5;    // Data segment

int main() {
    int localVar = 1;        // Stack
    int *heapVar = new int;  // Heap
    *heapVar = 50;

    cout << "Code (Text) Segment Example: main() function\n";
    cout << "Data Segment: globalVar = " << globalVar << ", staticVar = " << staticVar << endl;
    cout << "Stack Variable: localVar = " << localVar << endl;
    cout << "Heap Variable: *heapVar = " << *heapVar << endl;

    delete heapVar; // Free heap memory
    return 0;
}
```

### **Output:**

```
Code (Text) Segment Example: main() function
Data Segment: globalVar = 10, staticVar = 5
Stack Variable: localVar = 1
Heap Variable: *heapVar = 50
```

---

## **6. Problem Example:**

**Q. Why are the code and data segments separated in process memory?**

### **Solution:**

* The **code segment** is kept **read-only** to prevent accidental overwrites.
* The **data segment** is **read/write**, allowing modification of variables.
* This separation enhances **security** and **system stability**.

## **7. Process Control Block (PCB)**

Each process also has a **PCB**, which the OS uses to manage process state.

| Field                  | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Process ID (PID)       | Unique identifier                        |
| Process State          | New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated |
| Program Counter        | Address of next instruction              |
| CPU Registers          | Stored during context switch             |
| Memory Management Info | Base/limit registers                     |
| Accounting Info        | CPU usage, process time                  |
| I/O Status Info        | Devices allocated to process             |

* Understanding these segments helps in debugging, system programming, and interview problem-solving.
* These fundamentals directly connect with **memory management**, **scheduling**, and **context switching**.
