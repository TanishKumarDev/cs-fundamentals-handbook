# **Process in Operating System**

---

## **1. Introduction**

A **process** is a **program in execution**. Unlike a program, which is a **passive entity** (just code on disk), a process is **active**, with its own execution context.

> Example:
>
> * Writing a C/C++ program generates a binary file.
> * Running the binary creates a **process**.
> * Opening the same binary multiple times generates **multiple processes**.

## **2. Process in Memory**

A process in memory is divided into sections for different purposes:

| Section                 | Purpose                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text (Code) Section** | Contains executable instructions (usually **read-only**)                     |
| **Stack**               | Holds temporary data: function parameters, return addresses, local variables |
| **Data Section**        | Stores **global variables**                                                  |
| **Heap Section**        | Memory dynamically allocated during runtime                                  |

## **3. Attributes of a Process**

All key information about a process is stored in a **Process Control Block (PCB)** (or Task Control Block).

### **Key Attributes:**

1. **Process ID (PID)**

   * Unique number to identify each process.

2. **Process State**

   * Current status: `running`, `waiting`, `ready`, etc.

3. **Priority & CPU Scheduling Info**

   * Helps OS decide **which process runs next**.
   * Includes priority levels and pointers to scheduling queues.

4. **I/O Information**

   * Tracks **input/output devices** the process is using.

5. **File Descriptors**

   * Open files, sockets, or network connections.

6. **Accounting Information**

   * CPU time used, duration of execution, resource usage.

7. **Memory Management Information**

   * Memory allocated to the process.
   * Includes stack, heap, data, and code locations.

## **4. Importance of PCB**

* Acts as the **central repository of process information**
* Helps OS **control, schedule, and manage** processes efficiently
* Enables **context switching** between processes
