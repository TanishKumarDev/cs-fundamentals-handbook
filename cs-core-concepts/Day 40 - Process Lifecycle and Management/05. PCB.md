# **Process Table and Process Control Block (PCB) – Operating System**

---

A **Process Control Block (PCB)** is a data structure used by the OS to **track and manage each process**. Every process has one PCB.

The **Process Table** is a collection (array) of all PCBs, representing **all active processes** in the system.

A PCB stores **all essential information about a process**:

| Field                    | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Process ID (PID)**     | Unique identifier for the process.                                       |
| **Process State**        | Current state: New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Terminated, etc.            |
| **Program Counter (PC)** | Address of the **next instruction** to execute.                          |
| **CPU Registers**        | Current values of CPU registers; saved/restored during context switches. |
| **Stack Pointer**        | Points to the process’s stack; essential for switching.                  |
| **Memory Limits**        | Memory allocation info: page tables, segment tables, etc.                |
| **List of Open Files**   | Tracks files opened by the process.                                      |
| **CPU Scheduling Info**  | Priority, CPU burst time, arrival time, etc.                             |
| **I/O Information**      | Devices used by the process.                                             |
| **Accounting Info**      | CPU time used, resource usage statistics.                                |
| **Security Info**        | User ID, group ID, permission levels.                                    |

> **Note:** PCB is stored in a protected part of memory inaccessible to normal user processes. Often placed at the start of the kernel stack.

## **2. Process Table**

* A **Process Table** contains **entries for all active processes**.
* Each entry usually points to a PCB.
* Some quick-access info (like PID, state, or priority) may be stored directly in the table for efficiency.

**Role of Process Table:**

* Mapping PID → PCB
* Quick reference for OS scheduling and monitoring

## **3. Roles of PCB & Process Table**

| Function                                        | How PCB / Table Helps                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduling**                                  | Contains priority, CPU burst times, arrival times; aids CPU scheduler.              |
| **Context Switching**                           | Stores registers, stack pointers, and other state info to switch between processes. |
| **Interrupt Handling**                          | Tracks interrupts generated by the process.                                         |
| **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**           | Stores pointers or flags for shared memory, pipes, message queues.                  |
| **Resource Allocation**                         | Tracks memory, files, and I/O devices allocated to the process.                     |
| **Process Synchronization & Deadlock Handling** | Maintains info about locks held/requested; helps detect & resolve deadlocks.        |
| **Security & Access Control**                   | Holds user ID, group ID, permission levels for enforcing access control.            |
| **Debugging & Monitoring**                      | Process Table is used by tools like `top`, `ps` to display process info.            |
| **Virtual Memory Management**                   | Contains page tables, virtual memory info, and page fault handling.                 |
| **Real-Time Systems**                           | Stores deadlines, priorities, and timing info for time-critical processes.          |

### **4. Summary**

* **PCB = process-specific information**, including state, registers, memory, and resources.
* **Process Table = collection of all PCBs**, allowing the OS to manage all active processes.
* Essential for **scheduling, context switching, resource allocation, IPC, and security**.
* Without PCBs and process tables, an OS cannot **efficiently track or control processes**.
