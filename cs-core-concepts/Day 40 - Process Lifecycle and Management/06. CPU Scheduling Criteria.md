# **CPU Scheduling Criteria – Operating System**

---

CPU scheduling is crucial to **maximize CPU efficiency** and ensure processes run smoothly. The **CPU scheduler** decides **which process runs next** and for how long, based on various criteria.

## **1. Key Criteria for CPU Scheduling**

### **1. CPU Utilization**

* Goal: Keep the CPU as busy as possible.
* Ideal utilization: **40%–90%** in real-time systems.
* Higher CPU utilization → more efficient system.

### **2. Throughput**

* Definition: **Number of processes completed per unit time.**
* High throughput → more work done.
* Affected by process lengths and durations.

### **3. Turnaround Time**

* Definition: Total time taken **from process submission to completion**.
* Includes: waiting time + execution time + I/O delays.
* Formula:
  [
  \text{Turnaround Time} = \text{Completion Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
  ]

### **4. Waiting Time**

* Time spent **waiting in the ready queue** before getting CPU.
* Formula:
  [
  \text{Waiting Time} = \text{Turnaround Time} - \text{Burst Time}
  ]

### **5. Response Time**

* Important for **interactive systems**.
* Time from submission to **first response/output**.
* Formula:
  [
  \text{Response Time} = \text{First CPU Allocation Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
  ]

### **6. Completion Time**

* Time when a process **finishes execution**.

### **7. Priority**

* Some OS assign **priority levels** to processes.
* Scheduler favors **higher-priority processes**.

### **8. Predictability**

* Process should run in **roughly the same time** under similar load conditions.

## **2. Importance of Choosing the Right Algorithm**

* Different algorithms prioritize **different criteria**.
* Wrong choice → suboptimal system performance.

**Examples:**

* **Round Robin** → Time-sharing systems (short response time needed)
* **Shortest Job First (SJF)** → Batch processing (maximize throughput)
* **Priority Scheduling** → Real-time systems (ensure urgent tasks complete first)

## **3. Factors Influencing CPU Scheduling**

1. Number of processes
2. Required processing time
3. Task urgency
4. System requirements

Choosing the **right algorithm** ensures efficient resource use, higher productivity, and better user satisfaction.

### **A. Non-Preemptive**

* **First Come First Served (FCFS)**
* **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
* **Longest Job First (LJF)**

### **B. Preemptive**

* **Priority Scheduling**
* **Round Robin (RR)**
* **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
* **Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)**
* **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
* **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**

> CPU scheduling ensures **efficient system resource usage** and balances metrics like CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.
