# **Process Schedulers in Operating System**

Process scheduling is a key OS activity that decides **which process gets CPU time** and **in what order**, ensuring smooth execution and efficient resource use. Processes move between various scheduling queues such as **ready queue**, **waiting queue**, or **I/O devices queue**.

---

## **1. Categories of Scheduling**

### **A. Non-Preemptive**

* Once a process gets the CPU, it **cannot be interrupted** until it finishes or waits for I/O.
* Example: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).

### **B. Preemptive**

* The OS **can suspend a running process** and move it back to ready state.
* Allows higher-priority processes to run first.
* Example: Round Robin, Priority Scheduling.

## **2. Types of Process Schedulers**

Schedulers manage the **CPU allocation** among processes:

### **2.1 Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler)**

* Loads processes from **disk to main memory**.
* Moves processes from **Job Queue → Ready Queue**.
* Controls **degree of multiprogramming** (how many processes in memory).
* Balances **CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes** for efficiency.
* Slowest among schedulers → called **long-term**.
* May not exist in **time-sharing systems** (Windows, Linux desktop).

---

### **2.2 Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)**

* Selects a process from the **ready queue** for execution.
* Executes **frequent scheduling** to avoid starvation.
* Uses **CPU scheduling algorithms**: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, etc.
* Main goal: maximize **CPU utilization**.
* Works with **dispatcher** to load process into CPU (Ready → Running).
* Fastest among schedulers → called **short-term**.

#### **Dispatcher**

* Special program triggered by short-term scheduler.
* Responsibilities:

  1. **Context Switching** – saves old process state, loads new one.
  2. **Switching to User Mode** – ensures safe execution.
  3. **Jump to Program Location** – resumes process execution.
* Time taken = **dispatch latency**.

**Example (FCFS Scheduling)**:

* Ready queue: P1, P2, P3, P4 (arrival order).
* Scheduler selects P1 → Dispatcher gives CPU → P2 → P3 → P4.

---

### **2.3 Medium-Term Scheduler**

* Handles **swapping**: moves process between **memory ↔ disk**.
* Reduces **degree of multiprogramming** to improve process mix.
* Suspended processes (waiting for I/O) may be swapped out to free memory.
* Slower than short-term, faster than long-term.
* Can bring processes back to memory, resuming execution.

---

### **Other Schedulers**

* **I/O Scheduler**: Manages order of I/O operations (disk/network). Algorithms: FCFS, Round Robin, etc.
* **Real-Time Scheduler**: Ensures **time-critical tasks** meet deadlines. Algorithms: EDF (Earliest Deadline First), RM (Rate Monotonic).

## **3. Comparison Table**

| Scheduler Type   | Main Role                 | Speed    | Multiprogramming Control | Key Feature                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Long-Term (Job)  | Job selection             | Slowest  | Controls degree          | Balances CPU & I/O bound tasks     |
| Short-Term (CPU) | Process selection for CPU | Fastest  | Minimal control          | Uses dispatcher for context switch |
| Medium-Term      | Swapping & suspension     | Moderate | Reduces degree           | Reintroduces suspended processes   |

Schedulers collectively ensure:

* Efficient CPU usage
* Balanced execution of CPU & I/O-bound processes
* Smooth context switching and process resumption
