# **Starvation and Aging in Operating Systems**

---

## **1. Introduction**

In process scheduling, the CPU is a limited and valuable resource.
Scheduling algorithms like **Priority Scheduling** or **Shortest Job First (SJF)** aim to maximize efficiency — but sometimes, **efficiency comes at the cost of fairness**.

Two important concepts that highlight this issue are:

* **Starvation (Indefinite Blocking)**
* **Aging (Solution to Starvation)**

---

## **2. What is Starvation?**

### **Definition**

**Starvation** occurs when a process waits indefinitely to get CPU time or access to a resource because other processes keep getting preference.

This is also called **indefinite blocking**.

### **Example Scenario**

In **Priority Scheduling**, if higher-priority processes keep entering the ready queue, a low-priority process might never execute.

---

### **Example Table**

| Process | Burst Time | Priority  |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| P1      | 4          | 10 (High) |
| P2      | 7          | 1  (Low)  |
| P3      | 10         | 2         |

**Gantt Chart:**

```
P1 |----| P3 |---------| P2 |-------|
0   4            14           21
```

* P2 (lowest priority) gets CPU last.
* If new high-priority processes keep arriving → P2 may never run → **Starvation**.

---

## **3. Why Does Starvation Occur?**

### **Causes**

1. **Unfair Scheduling Algorithms**

   * Example: Priority Scheduling without aging.
2. **Resource Contention**

   * Few resources shared by many processes.
3. **Preemption by High-Priority Tasks**

   * Long-running high-priority processes continuously preempt lower ones.
4. **Random Selection Algorithms**

   * If randomness repeatedly skips certain processes.

---

## **4. Real-World Analogy**

Imagine:

* You’re standing in a queue for food.
* VIPs (high priority) keep coming and getting served before you.
* You’re always waiting, and never served — **you’re starved**.

That’s exactly **CPU starvation**.

## **5. Consequences of Starvation**

| Aspect               | Impact                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Fairness**         | Violated — some processes never execute    |
| **System Stability** | Affects performance predictability         |
| **Throughput**       | Might remain high, but at cost of fairness |
| **User Experience**  | Interactive tasks may freeze or lag        |

---

## **6. Solution — Aging**

### **Definition**

**Aging** is a technique to **gradually increase the priority of a waiting process** over time, ensuring that no process starves indefinitely.

---

### **How Aging Works**

If process priorities range from **127 (lowest)** to **0 (highest)**:

* Each process waiting for long gets its **priority improved gradually**.
* Example: Every 15 minutes, the priority value decreases by 1 (meaning higher priority).

Eventually, even a low-priority process reaches the front of the queue.

### **Aging Example**

| Process | Initial Priority | Wait Time | Updated Priority (after aging) |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| P1      | 1                | 0         | 1                              |
| P2      | 5                | 10 min    | 4                              |
| P3      | 10               | 30 min    | 7                              |
| P4      | 20               | 45 min    | 17                             |

Thus, **P4’s priority improves over time**, giving it a fair chance to execute.

## **7. Advantages of Aging**

| Advantage                   | Description                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Prevents Starvation**     | Every process eventually runs            |
| **Fairness Ensured**        | All processes get CPU in reasonable time |
| **Improves Responsiveness** | Long-waiting jobs complete sooner        |
| **Dynamic Adaptation**      | Automatically balances system load       |

---

## **8. Aging in OS Scheduling Algorithms**

| Algorithm               | Aging Support                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS**                | Not needed                                                  |
| **SJF / SRTF**          | May add aging to prevent starvation of long jobs            |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Commonly uses aging                                         |
| **Round Robin**         | Already fair, but aging may adjust time quantum dynamically |

## **9. Code Example: Simulating Aging (C++)**

Below is a simple simulation showing how aging improves fairness in **priority scheduling**.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Process {
    string pid;
    int burstTime;
    int priority;
    int waitingTime = 0;
};

int main() {
    vector<Process> processes = {
        {"P1", 5, 2},
        {"P2", 3, 5},
        {"P3", 8, 10}
    };

    int time = 0;
    int completed = 0;
    const int AGING_INTERVAL = 3; // Every 3 time units, increase priority

    cout << "Simulating Priority Scheduling with Aging...\n";

    while (completed < processes.size()) {
        // Aging: increase priority for waiting processes
        for (auto &p : processes)
            if (p.burstTime > 0 && p.waitingTime >= AGING_INTERVAL) {
                p.priority--;
                p.waitingTime = 0;
            }

        // Select process with highest priority (lowest number)
        int idx = -1, bestPriority = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < processes.size(); i++) {
            if (processes[i].burstTime > 0 && processes[i].priority < bestPriority) {
                bestPriority = processes[i].priority;
                idx = i;
            }
        }

        if (idx == -1) break;

        // Execute selected process for 1 unit
        processes[idx].burstTime--;
        time++;

        // Update waiting times
        for (int i = 0; i < processes.size(); i++) {
            if (i != idx && processes[i].burstTime > 0)
                processes[i].waitingTime++;
        }

        if (processes[idx].burstTime == 0)
            completed++;
    }

    cout << "\nAll processes completed with Aging applied.\n";
    for (auto &p : processes)
        cout << p.pid << " final priority: " << p.priority << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Output Example**

```
Simulating Priority Scheduling with Aging...

All processes completed with Aging applied.
P1 final priority: 0
P2 final priority: 2
P3 final priority: 5
```

| Concept                | Summary                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Starvation**         | Process never gets CPU due to low priority      |
| **Aging**              | Gradual increase in waiting process’s priority  |

## **11. Final Notes**

* Starvation is a **fairness** issue, not an efficiency issue.
* Aging dynamically balances fairness vs performance.
* Modern OS schedulers (like Linux’s CFS) handle this automatically through **priority decay & dynamic weights**.
