# Day 5 – Enhanced ER Model

## Article 2: Enhanced ER (EER) Model

### **1. Overview**

As data becomes more complex, the traditional ER model may not fully capture all relationships and constraints. The **Enhanced ER (EER) Model** extends the ER model to represent complex databases more effectively. It includes all ER concepts and adds:

*The ER model is the abstract representation of a database structure that defines:*

* Entities in a database.
* Attributes that they had.
* Relationships between them.

* Subclasses and Superclasses
* Generalization and Specialization
* Category (Union) types
* Attribute and Relationship Inheritance
* Aggregation

---

### **2. Subclass and Superclass**

* **Superclass** – Higher-level entity with common attributes.
* **Subclass** – Lower-level entity that inherits attributes and relationships from its superclass and may have additional attributes.

**Example:**

* Superclass: Science
* Subclasses: Physics, Chemistry, Biology

**Inheritance:**
A subclass automatically inherits all attributes of its superclass.

---

### **3. Generalization and Specialization**

* **Generalization** – Combines common features of multiple entity sets into a single supertype.
    * *Example: Here we have three sets of employees: Secretary, Technician and Engineer. The employee is a super-class of the rest three sets of individual sub-class is a subset of Employee set.*

        * An entity belonging to a sub-class is related to some super-class entity. For instance emp, no 1001 is a secretary and his typing speed is 68. Emp no 1009 is an engineer (sub-class) and her trade is “Electrical”, so forth.
        * Sub-class entity “inherits” all attributes of super-class; for example, employee 1001 will have attributes eno, name, salary and typing speed.
    * Enhanced ER Model of Above Example:

* **Specialization** – Defines subtypes with unique attributes from a supertype.

**Example:**

* Superclass: Employee
* Subclasses: Secretary, Technician, Engineer

Each subclass inherits general attributes like `EmpID`, `Name`, `Salary`, and may add specific attributes (e.g., typing speed for Secretary).

---

### **4. Subclass Constraints**

1. **Total vs Partial Subclassing**

    * Total: Every entity in the superclass must be in at least one subclass (e.g., every employee is either salaried or hourly).
    * Partial: Some entities may not belong to any subclass (e.g., not all employees are a secretary, engineer or technician).
    * Total subclassing means complete coverage while, partial means incomplete coverage.

2. **Overlapped vs Disjoint Subclassing**

   * Overlapped: An entity can belong to multiple subclasses.
   * Disjoint: An entity belongs to only one subclass.
   * In the given examples, both job-type and salary-based subclassing are disjoint, meaning no overlap.

---

### **5. Category / Union Type**

* A **Category (Union)** is a subclass derived from two or more unrelated superclasses.
* Represents entities that can belong to more than one entity set.

**Example:**

* Library Member = Faculty ∪ Student ∪ Staff
* Vehicle Owner = Person ∪ Company

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716175818621121/EER-Model-2.webp)
Union types allow modeling without enforcing inheritance.

---

### **6. Attribute and Relationship Inheritance**

* Subclasses inherit all attributes and relationships of their superclasses.
* Supports **reusability** and **consistency**, avoiding redundant definitions.
* Multiple inheritance is allowed; attributes of a subclass are the union of all superclasses.

* **Example:**
    *If Employee has attributes like Name and ID, all subclasses like Manager or Engineer will automatically have these, in addition to their own unique attributes (like Department or Project).*

    * Superclass Employee: `Name`, `ID`
    * Subclass Manager: inherits `Name`, `ID` and adds `Department`
    * Subclass Engineer: inherits `Name`, `ID` and adds `Project`

### **7. Key Features of EER Model**

1. **Subtypes and Supertypes** – Hierarchical structure with general and specialized entities.
2. **Generalization and Specialization** – Abstracts common attributes or specifies unique ones.
3. **Inheritance** – Subclasses inherit attributes and relationships.
4. **Constraints** – Total/Partial, Disjoint/Overlapped.
5. **Union Types** – Entities can belong to multiple superclasses without attribute inheritance.
6. **Aggregation** – Groups entities into a single higher-level entity.
7. **Multi-valued Attributes** – Attributes with multiple values per entity.
8. **Relationships with Attributes** – Relationships themselves can have descriptive attributes.
