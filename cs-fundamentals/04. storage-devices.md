## 🧠 Day 4: Computer Memory & Storage Devices

---

### 🩵 **What is Computer Memory?**

* Memory = Electronic storage space where CPU stores data/instructions temporarily or permanently.
* Acts as the brain of the computer for **data storage + retrieval**.
* Communication between CPU & memory happens via the **System Bus**:

  * **Data Bus:** Transfers data.
  * **Address Bus:** Carries address locations.
  * **Control Bus:** Manages read/write control signals.
* **Memory Controller** synchronizes these operations.

## ⚙️ Types of Computer Memory

| Type                 | Nature                  | Function                                       | Example           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Primary Memory**   | Volatile / Non-Volatile | Fast, directly accessible by CPU               | RAM, ROM, Cache   |
| **Secondary Memory** | Non-Volatile            | Long-term, large capacity storage              | HDD, SSD, CD, USB |
| **Cache Memory**     | Volatile                | Ultra-fast temporary storage between CPU & RAM | L1, L2, L3        |

## 🩷 1️⃣ Primary Memory

* Also called **Main Memory**.
* Used to **store data/programs currently in use**.
* Located on **motherboard** and **directly accessible** by CPU.

### 🔹 Types:

#### 🧩 **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

* **Volatile:** Data lost when power is off.
* Temporarily stores programs being executed.
* **Types:**

  * **SRAM (Static RAM)** → uses flip-flops; faster, expensive.
  * **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)** → uses capacitors; slower, cheaper, needs refreshing.

#### 🧩 **ROM (Read Only Memory)**

* **Non-volatile:** Data retained even after power loss.
* Stores system instructions (bootloader/firmware).
* **Types:**

  * **MROM (Masked ROM):** Pre-programmed, cannot modify.
  * **PROM:** User-programmable once.
  * **EPROM:** Erasable via UV light (~40 min).
  * **EEPROM:** Erasable electrically (fast, up to 10k rewrites).

## 💾 2️⃣ Secondary Memory

* Also called **Auxiliary or Backup Memory**.
* **Non-volatile**, **large capacity**, **slower** than primary memory.
* CPU **cannot access directly** — data must be loaded into main memory first.

### 🔹 Characteristics:

* Permanent & reusable
* Cheaper & high storage
* Slower access time
* Not essential for CPU operation

### 🔹 Types of Secondary Storage:

#### 🧲 **Magnetic Storage**

* **Magnetic Tape:** Sequential access; used for backups.
* **Magnetic Disk (HDD):** Circular metal plate with magnetic coating; random access.

#### 💿 **Optical Storage**

* Uses **laser beams** to read/write.
* Types:

  * **CD-ROM:** 600 MB, read-only.
  * **WORM:** Write once, read many.
  * **DVD:** 4.7–17 GB, multiple layers.
  * **Blu-ray:** 25–50 GB, for HD video.

#### ⚡ **Flash & Cloud Storage**

* **USB Drives**, **SD Cards**, **SSDs**, **Cloud Storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)**.
* Faster and more portable options.

### 🔹 Based on Portability:

| Category              | Examples                 | Description           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Fixed Devices**     | HDD, SSD, NAS            | Permanently installed |
| **Removable Devices** | CD, DVD, USB, Flash Card | Portable & reusable   |

## ⚡ 3️⃣ Cache Memory

* **High-speed memory** between CPU and RAM.
* Stores **frequently used data/instructions** for quick access.
* Based on **locality of reference principle** (recently used → likely reused).

### 🔹 Working:

1. CPU checks cache for data.

   * If found → **Cache Hit**
   * If not found → **Cache Miss** (fetches from RAM)
2. Frequently used data moved to cache for next time.
3. Drastically reduces CPU idle time.

### 🔹 Levels of Cache:

| Level        | Location           | Size        | Speed               |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| **L1 Cache** | Inside CPU Core    | 2KB–64KB    | Fastest             |
| **L2 Cache** | Inside/Outside CPU | 256KB–512KB | Slower than L1      |
| **L3 Cache** | Shared among cores | 1MB–8MB     | Slowest among cache |

### 🔹 Advantages:

* Faster than main memory
* Reduces CPU waiting time
* Improves overall performance

### 🔹 Disadvantages:

* Expensive
* Small storage size

## 🧮 Memory Hierarchy (Speed → Cost → Size)

```
Registers  →  Cache  →  RAM  →  Secondary Storage
 (Fastest)     ↑        ↑         (Slowest)
 (Smallest)    |        |         (Largest)
```

## ⚡ Quick Comparison

| Feature              | Primary Memory        | Secondary Memory | Cache Memory   |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Speed**            | Fast                  | Slow             | Very Fast      |
| **Volatility**       | Volatile/Non-Volatile | Non-Volatile     | Volatile       |
| **Cost**             | Expensive             | Cheap            | Very Expensive |
| **Access by CPU**    | Direct                | Indirect         | Direct         |
| **Storage Capacity** | Limited               | Very Large       | Very Small     |

## 🧩 Takeaways

* **Primary memory** = Working memory for CPU.
* **Secondary memory** = Long-term data storage.
* **Cache memory** = Speed booster for CPU.
* Understanding the **hierarchy** helps optimize data access & system performance.
