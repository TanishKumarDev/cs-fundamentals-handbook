# 🧠 Day 3 – Data Representation in Computer

---

## 🟣 1. Introduction

Everything in a computer—text, images, audio, video, or programs—is stored as **binary data (0s and 1s)**.
This is because the computer’s hardware operates on two states: **ON (1)** and **OFF (0)**.

Humans use the **decimal system (base 10)**, while computers use the **binary system (base 2)**.
To make data easier to read or store, other systems like **octal (base 8)** and **hexadecimal (base 16)** are also used.

---

## 🟩 2. Number Systems

### 💡 Definition

A **number system** is a way to represent numbers using a set of symbols and rules.
Each number system has a **base (or radix)**, which defines how many unique digits it uses.

| System      | Base | Digits Used | Example |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Decimal     | 10   | 0–9         | 145     |
| Binary      | 2    | 0, 1        | 1011    |
| Octal       | 8    | 0–7         | 325     |
| Hexadecimal | 16   | 0–9, A–F    | 2F      |

---

### 🔹 2.1 Decimal Number System (Base 10)

* Most familiar to humans.
* Uses **10 digits** (0–9).
* Each digit’s place value is a power of 10.

**Example:**

```
10285 = (1×10⁴) + (0×10³) + (2×10²) + (8×10¹) + (5×10⁰)
= 10000 + 0 + 200 + 80 + 5
= 10285
```

---

### 🔹 2.2 Binary Number System (Base 2)

* Used internally by all computers.
* Uses **two digits**: 0 and 1.
* Each digit represents a power of 2.

**Example:**

```
(1011)₂ = 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 (in decimal)
```

---

### 🔹 2.3 Octal Number System (Base 8)

* Uses **digits 0–7**.
* Compact form of binary (3 bits per octal digit).
* Often used in **UNIX file permissions**.

**Example:**

```
(325)₈ = 3×8² + 2×8¹ + 5×8⁰
= 192 + 16 + 5 = 213 (in decimal)
```

---

### 🔹 2.4 Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)

* Uses **digits 0–9 and letters A–F** (A=10 … F=15).
* Compact representation of binary (4 bits per hex digit).
* Widely used in **memory addresses** and **color codes**.

**Example:**

```
(2F)₁₆ = 2×16¹ + F×16⁰
= 32 + 15 = 47 (in decimal)
```

---

## 🟩 3. Bit and Byte

### 🧱 Bit

* Short for **Binary Digit**.
* Smallest unit of data (either **0** or **1**).
* Used to represent data transmission speed (e.g., 10 Mbps).

### 🧱 Byte

* Collection of **8 bits**.
* Smallest addressable unit of memory.
* Stores one character (e.g., ‘A’, ‘3’, or ‘@’).
* Used to represent data storage (e.g., 10 MB file).

| Unit       | Relationship | Common Use        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| **1 Byte** | 8 Bits       | Store 1 character |
| **1 KB**   | 1024 Bytes   | Small text file   |
| **1 MB**   | 1024 KB      | Image / song      |
| **1 GB**   | 1024 MB      | Video / app       |
| **1 TB**   | 1024 GB      | Large datasets    |

### ⚡ Bit vs Byte Comparison

| Feature     | Bit                       | Byte             |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Size        | Smallest data unit        | 8 bits           |
| Symbol      | b                         | B                |
| Value range | 2 values (0,1)            | 256 values       |
| Usage       | Data speed (Mbps)         | Storage (MB, GB) |
| Example     | 10 Mbps = 10 Megabits/sec | 10 MB = 80 Mbps  |

## 🟩 4. Character Encoding Systems

### 💡 Why Needed

Computers only understand binary. To store and process **text**, characters must be converted into **binary codes** — this process is called **character encoding**.

---

### 🔹 ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

* **7-bit encoding** (128 characters).
* Represents English letters, digits, and symbols.
* Example:

  * ‘A’ → 65
  * ‘a’ → 97
  * Space → 32

🧩 **Limitation:**
Only supports English — can’t represent symbols or characters from other languages.

---

### 🔹 Unicode

* A **universal character encoding** that supports all writing systems.
* Each character is assigned a **unique code point** (e.g., U+0041 for ‘A’).
* Unicode doesn’t define how data is stored; that’s handled by **UTF (Unicode Transformation Formats).**

### 🔸 UTF Formats

| Format     | Bits per Character | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **UTF-8**  | 8–32 bits          | Variable-length, ASCII-compatible, most common |
| **UTF-16** | 16 bits            | Used by Windows, Java                          |
| **UTF-32** | 32 bits            | Fixed length, simple but memory-heavy          |

**Example (UTF-8 Encoding):**

```
Character: 'A'  
Unicode: U+0041  
Binary: 01000001  
UTF-8 Hex: 41  
```

**Example (UTF-16 for “BUS”):**

```
B → 00 42  
U → 00 55  
S → 00 53  
Stored as: 00 42 00 55 00 53
```
