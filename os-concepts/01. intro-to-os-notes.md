# Intro to OS

## **1. What is an OS?**

### **Simple Definition**:

An OS is like a **"super manager"** of your computer:

- It **controls all hardware** (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.).
- It **helps apps run** without fighting over resources.
- It **protects apps** from crashing each other.

### **Technical Definition**:

> "Software that manages hardware/software resources and lets users run programs efficiently."

### **Before OS** ?

Before operating systems (OS), **computers were run by individuals who physically loaded programs and data onto the machine, often using punch cards or magnetic tape**. These users would schedule their programs and wait for them to complete, with the time spent loading often exceeding the time the program ran. Essentially, the **user was the OS, managing all aspects of the computer's operation.**

**Here's a more detailed look:**

- **No operating system:**
    
    Early computers lacked any form of operating system, so users were directly interacting with the hardware.
    
- **Manual loading:**
    
    Programs and data were loaded manually onto the machine using physical media like punch cards or magnetic tape.
    
- **User as operator:**
    
    Users would physically load their programs, schedule their runtimes, and wait for the program to complete, essentially acting as the "operator".
    
- **Early batch processing:**
    
    When computers became faster, operators would still have to manually load programs and data in a queue, a precursor to batch processing.
    
- **Hardware-level programming:**
    
    Early computers were programmed in machine language or assembly language, which required a deeper understanding of the hardware.
    
- **Limited multitasking:**
    
    Before operating systems, computers could only execute one program at a time, making multitasking impossible.
    
- **Rise of operating systems:**
    
    Operating systems emerged to manage resources, handle input/output, and allow multiple programs to run concurrently, simplifying the process of using computers.
    


## **2. Why Does an OS Exist?**

*(What if there was NO OS?)*

### **Problem 1: Resource Chaos (No Fairness)**

- **Example**: TikTok vs. PUBG on a phone.
    - **Without OS**: TikTok hogs 100% CPU/RAM → PUBG crashes.
    - **With OS**: TikTok gets 20%, PUBG gets 50% → Both run smoothly.
    - **Key Idea**: **Resource Management** (OS acts as a referee).

### **Problem 2: Apps Become Too Complex**

- **Without OS**: Every app must handle:
    - Memory management (`malloc` in C++).
    - CPU sharing.
    - Disk access.
- **Result**: Apps grow huge (e.g., 50MB app → 800MB).
- **OS Solution**: **DRY Principle** (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
    - OS handles hardware tasks → Developers focus on app logic.

### **Problem 3: No Security/Isolation**

- **Without OS**:
    - TikTok can **modify PUBG’s memory** (e.g., set health = 0%).
    - Apps crash or behave unpredictably.
- **OS Solution**:
    - **Memory Protection**: Apps can’t access each other’s memory.
    - **Isolation**: Apps run in separate "sandboxes."

## **3. How Does an OS Solve These Problems?**

### **(A) Resource Manager (The Referee)**

- **What?** Divides CPU/RAM/GPU fairly.
- **How?**
    - Uses **scheduling algorithms** (like a time-share system).
    - Example:
        - TikTok: 5% CPU, 10% RAM.
        - PUBG: 50% CPU, 60% GPU.

### **(B) Interface (The Middleman)**

- **Analogy**: Bank Teller (OS) between you (App) and vault (Hardware).
    - You don’t touch cash directly → Teller handles it.
    - Apps don’t touch hardware → OS manages it.

- **Example in C++**:
    
    ```cpp
    int* arr = new int[10]; // OS finds free memory, app doesn’t care where.
    
    ```
    

### **(C) Abstraction (Hiding Complexity)**

- **What?** OS hides hardware details.
- **Why?** So developers don’t worry about:
    - Which RAM sector is free?
    - How to talk to the GPU?
- **Example**:
    - You use `cout << "Hello"` → OS converts it to pixels on screen.

### **(D) Protection (The Bodyguard)**

- **How?**
    1. **Memory Isolation**: Each app gets its own "playground."
    2. **Permissions**: Apps can’t access others’ data without OS approval.
- **Example**:
    - TikTok can’t corrupt PUBG’s memory.

## **4. Key Concepts Simplified**

| Concept | Real-Life Example | Tech Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Resource Mgmt** | Traffic light (controls cars) | CPU scheduling |
| **Interface** | Restaurant waiter | System calls (`malloc`, `open`) |
| **Abstraction** | Driving a car (no engine knowledge) | Using `printf()` without knowing how it prints |
| **Protection** | Locked personal locker | Memory isolation (TikTok ≠ PUBG) |
