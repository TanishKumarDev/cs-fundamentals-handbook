# Network Cabling and Connectors

Network cabling and connectors are the physical infrastructure that enables data transmission between devices in a network. Cabling carries signals (electrical or optical), while connectors ensure secure, reliable links between cables and devices. They operate primarily at the Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1) and are critical for network performance.

Key types of cabling:

- **Twisted Pair**: Copper wires twisted to reduce interference; used in Ethernet LANs.
    - **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**: Common (e.g., Cat5e, Cat6), cost-effective.
    - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)**: Extra shielding for high-interference environments.
- **Coaxial Cable**: Central conductor with a shield; used in older LANs and cable internet.
- **Fiber Optic**: Glass/plastic fibers transmitting light; high-speed, long-distance (e.g., WANs).
- **Wireless**: Not a cable, but relevant for comparison (e.g., Wi-Fi, no physical medium).
