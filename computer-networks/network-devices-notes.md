# Computer Network Devices

Network devices are hardware components that facilitate communication, data transfer, and management within a computer network. They operate at different layers of the OSI model, performing tasks like connecting devices, routing data, or securing traffic. Each device has a specific role in ensuring efficient, reliable, and secure communication.

Key types of network devices:

- **Hub**: Operates at Physical Layer (Layer 1); broadcasts data to all connected devices (simple but inefficient).
- **Switch**: Operates at Data Link Layer (Layer 2); forwards data to specific devices based on MAC addresses, reducing congestion.
- **Router**: Operates at Network Layer (Layer 3); directs packets between networks using IP addresses, connecting LANs to WANs.
- **Access Point (AP)**: Enables wireless connectivity, bridging Wi-Fi devices to wired networks.
- **Modem**: Converts digital signals to analog (and vice versa) for internet access via ISPs.
- **Gateway**: Translates protocols between different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN).
- **Firewall**: Monitors and filters traffic for security (Layer 3-7).
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Enables devices to connect to networks (wired/wireless).

Think of devices as "traffic managers" in a city: hubs are like roundabouts sending cars everywhere, switches are smart intersections, and routers are GPS systems guiding packets across cities (networks).
