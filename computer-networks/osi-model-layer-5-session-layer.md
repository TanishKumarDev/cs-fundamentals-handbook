# 🌐 Session Layer

These are **Layer 5 and Layer 6** of the OSI model. They act as the “middleman” between **applications (Layer 7)** and the lower network layers (Transport, Network, Data Link, etc.).

# Session Layer (Layer 5)

The **Session Layer** is responsible for **establishing, managing, and terminating communication sessions** between two applications.

👉 Think: It’s like a **moderator in a meeting** – ensures communication happens in an organized, controlled way.

### ✨ Functions of Session Layer

1. **Session Establishment, Maintenance, Termination**

   * Starts a session (handshake), keeps it alive, and ends it properly.
   * Example: Logging into a website → server starts a session with you.

2. **Dialog Control**

   * Manages whether communication is **half-duplex** (one direction at a time) or **full-duplex** (both directions).

3. **Synchronization**

   * Places **checkpoints** in long data streams so if a crash occurs, transmission can resume from the checkpoint instead of starting over.

4. **Authentication & Authorization**

   * Works with Presentation Layer for secure session establishment (e.g., SSL/TLS sessions).

5. **Session Recovery**

   * If connection breaks, helps resume instead of restarting.

👉 **Real-World Example:**

* Video conferencing → maintains continuous session.
* Online banking → ensures secure, timed sessions.

# 🛠️ How to Explain in an Interview

**Q: What’s the difference between Session and Presentation Layer?**
👉

* Session: Manages **who talks to whom, when, and for how long**.
* Presentation: Ensures **what is said is understood correctly** (format, encryption, compression).

**Q: Give a real-life analogy.**
👉

* Session Layer = **phone call management** (dial, connect, maintain, hang up).
* Presentation Layer = **translator & security guard** (translates language, encrypts data, compresses message).

**Q: Example protocols?**
👉

* Session Layer: RPC, PPTP, NetBIOS.
* Presentation Layer: SSL/TLS, MIME, AFP.
