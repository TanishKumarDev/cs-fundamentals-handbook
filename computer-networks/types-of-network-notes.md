# Types of Networks
Types of networks refer to classifications based on geographical scope, purpose, or architecture, defining how devices are interconnected and the scale of communication. Each type serves specific use cases, from personal devices to global internet infrastructure.

Key types of networks:

- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Smallest scale (~10 meters), connects personal devices (e.g., smartphone, laptop, Bluetooth headset).
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Covers a small area (e.g., home, office, ~1 km), connects devices via switches/Wi-Fi for high-speed local access.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Spans a city (~10-50 km), often used for municipal services or campus networks.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Covers large distances (e.g., countries, continents), like the internet or corporate VPNs, using leased lines or satellites.
- **Other Types**:
    - **Campus Area Network (CAN)**: Multiple LANs in a university or corporate campus.
    - **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: Dedicated for high-speed storage access.
    - **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: Securely extends a private network over a public one (e.g., internet).
    - **Wireless LAN (WLAN)**: LAN using Wi-Fi, common in homes/offices.

Think of networks as roads: PANs are driveways, LANs are neighborhood streets, MANs are city highways, and WANs are intercontinental routes.
