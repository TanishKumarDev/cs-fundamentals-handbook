# ✅ FACTORY PATTERN VARIANTS — MASTER GUIDE

---

## 🔸 1. Simple Factory Pattern

### 🔍 What:

Not a formal GoF pattern. It’s a design **principle**.

A **central factory class** decides **which concrete class to instantiate** based on parameters.

### 🧠 Why:

You want to **centralize object creation logic** in one place — for basic use cases.

---

### 🛠️ How:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Common interface
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void printVehicle() = 0;
    virtual ~Vehicle() {}
};

// Concrete classes
class TwoWheeler : public Vehicle {
public:
    void printVehicle() override {
        cout << "Two Wheeler created.\n";
    }
};

class FourWheeler : public Vehicle {
public:
    void printVehicle() override {
        cout << "Four Wheeler created.\n";
    }
};

// Simple Factory
class SimpleVehicleFactory {
public:
    static Vehicle* createVehicle(int type) {
        if (type == 1) return new TwoWheeler();
        if (type == 2) return new FourWheeler();
        return nullptr;
    }
};

// Client
int main() {
    Vehicle* v1 = SimpleVehicleFactory::createVehicle(1);
    if (v1) v1->printVehicle();

    Vehicle* v2 = SimpleVehicleFactory::createVehicle(2);
    if (v2) v2->printVehicle();

    delete v1;
    delete v2;
}
```

### ✅ Key Points:

| Aspect          | Details                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔧 Object logic | Centralized in one class (`SimpleVehicleFactory`)    |
| ✅ Easy to use   | Yes — use static method                              |
| ❌ Drawback      | Violates OCP: adding new vehicle type → edit factory |
| 🔁 Flexibility  | Low — hardcoded logic                                |
| ✅ Use when      | Few object types and no subclassing logic needed     |

---

## 🔸 2. Factory Method Pattern (GoF ✅)

### 🔍 What:

A **creational GoF pattern** that defines an **interface for object creation**, but **lets subclasses decide** which object to return.

### 🧠 Why:

You want to **delegate object creation to subclasses**, and follow **Open/Closed Principle**.

---

### 🛠️ How:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Product Interface
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void printVehicle() = 0;
    virtual ~Vehicle() {}
};

// Concrete Products
class TwoWheeler : public Vehicle {
public:
    void printVehicle() override {
        cout << "FactoryMethod: Two Wheeler\n";
    }
};

class FourWheeler : public Vehicle {
public:
    void printVehicle() override {
        cout << "FactoryMethod: Four Wheeler\n";
    }
};

// Factory Interface (Abstract Creator)
class VehicleFactory {
public:
    virtual Vehicle* createVehicle() = 0;
    virtual ~VehicleFactory() {}
};

// Concrete Factories (Concrete Creators)
class TwoWheelerFactory : public VehicleFactory {
public:
    Vehicle* createVehicle() override {
        return new TwoWheeler();
    }
};

class FourWheelerFactory : public VehicleFactory {
public:
    Vehicle* createVehicle() override {
        return new FourWheeler();
    }
};

// Client
int main() {
    VehicleFactory* factory1 = new TwoWheelerFactory();
    Vehicle* v1 = factory1->createVehicle();
    v1->printVehicle();

    VehicleFactory* factory2 = new FourWheelerFactory();
    Vehicle* v2 = factory2->createVehicle();
    v2->printVehicle();

    delete v1;
    delete factory1;
    delete v2;
    delete factory2;
}
```

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔧 Object logic     | Delegated to **subclasses of factory**                                   |
| ✅ Open/Closed       | ✅ New product = new factory subclass                                     |
| 🔁 Flexibility      | High — new classes without modifying old code                            |
| 🔄 Use when         | Class has multiple subclasses and **which to use is decided at runtime** |
| 🔄 Example Use Case | UI Components for different platforms, Game object creation, etc.        |

## 🔸 3. Abstract Factory Pattern (GoF ✅)

### 🔍 What:

A **GoF creational pattern** that provides an interface to **create families of related objects** without knowing their concrete classes.

> Think of it as **"Factory of Factories"**.

---

### 🧠 Why:

You want to create a **set of related objects** — e.g., **UI kits**, **theme-based components**, **platform-based drivers**, etc.

---

### 🛠️ How:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Products A and B
class Button {
public:
    virtual void render() = 0;
    virtual ~Button() {}
};

class CheckBox {
public:
    virtual void render() = 0;
    virtual ~CheckBox() {}
};

// Concrete Products for Windows
class WindowsButton : public Button {
public:
    void render() override {
        cout << "Rendering Windows Button\n";
    }
};

class WindowsCheckBox : public CheckBox {
public:
    void render() override {
        cout << "Rendering Windows CheckBox\n";
    }
};

// Concrete Products for Mac
class MacButton : public Button {
public:
    void render() override {
        cout << "Rendering Mac Button\n";
    }
};

class MacCheckBox : public CheckBox {
public:
    void render() override {
        cout << "Rendering Mac CheckBox\n";
    }
};

// Abstract Factory
class GUIFactory {
public:
    virtual Button* createButton() = 0;
    virtual CheckBox* createCheckBox() = 0;
    virtual ~GUIFactory() {}
};

// Concrete Factory for Windows
class WindowsFactory : public GUIFactory {
public:
    Button* createButton() override {
        return new WindowsButton();
    }

    CheckBox* createCheckBox() override {
        return new WindowsCheckBox();
    }
};

// Concrete Factory for Mac
class MacFactory : public GUIFactory {
public:
    Button* createButton() override {
        return new MacButton();
    }

    CheckBox* createCheckBox() override {
        return new MacCheckBox();
    }
};

// Client
void createUI(GUIFactory* factory) {
    Button* btn = factory->createButton();
    CheckBox* chk = factory->createCheckBox();
    btn->render();
    chk->render();
    delete btn;
    delete chk;
}

// Main
int main() {
    GUIFactory* factory;

    // Windows UI
    factory = new WindowsFactory();
    createUI(factory);
    delete factory;

    // Mac UI
    factory = new MacFactory();
    createUI(factory);
    delete factory;

    return 0;
}
```

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Purpose              | Create **families of related objects** (e.g., UI toolkit) |
| 🔧 Factory of Factories | Each factory creates multiple related products            |
| 🧱 Products grouped     | By family (Windows/Mac)                                   |
| 🚫 Client knows nothing | About actual implementation                               |
| ✅ Follows SOLID         | Especially DIP (Dependency Inversion) & OCP               |
| 🔄 Use when             | Need to switch **product families** at runtime            |
