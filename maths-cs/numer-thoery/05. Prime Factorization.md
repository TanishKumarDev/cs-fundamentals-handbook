## **Prime Factorization**

### **What It Means**

**Prime Factorization** means breaking a number into a **product of prime numbers** (numbers that have only two factors — 1 and itself).

In short:
You keep dividing the number by prime numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 7, …)
until all remaining factors are prime.

Example:
12 = 2 × 6
6 = 2 × 3
So, 12 = **2 × 2 × 3**

### **Why It’s Important**

* Every composite number can be **uniquely** written as a product of prime numbers.
* This is called the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.
* Used in computer science fields like **cryptography**, **network security**, and **data compression**.

### **Two Main Methods**

#### **1. Division Method**

You repeatedly divide the number by the smallest possible prime number.

**Steps:**

1. Start dividing by 2.
2. Continue dividing by 2 until it no longer divides evenly.
3. Move to the next prime (3, 5, 7, …)
4. Stop when the quotient becomes 1.
5. All divisors used are the **prime factors**.

**Example: Find prime factorization of 60**

60 ÷ 2 = 30
30 ÷ 2 = 15
15 ÷ 3 = 5
5 ÷ 5 = 1

→ **Prime factors: 2 × 2 × 3 × 5**

---

#### **2. Factor Tree Method**

You split the number into factors until all branches end with primes.

**Example: 56**

56
→ 8 × 7
→ (2 × 2 × 2) × 7

→ **Prime factors: 2 × 2 × 2 × 7**

### **More Examples**

| Number | Prime Factorization |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| 12     | 2 × 2 × 3           |
| 36     | 2 × 2 × 3 × 3       |
| 48     | 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3   |
| 84     | 2 × 2 × 3 × 7       |
| 91     | 7 × 13              |

### **Relation with HCF and LCM**

* **HCF (Highest Common Factor)**
  Take **lowest power** of each common prime factor.

* **LCM (Lowest Common Multiple)**
  Take **highest power** of each prime factor.

**Example:**
Find HCF and LCM of 60 and 120.

60 = 2² × 3 × 5
120 = 2³ × 3 × 5

HCF = 2² × 3 × 5 = 60
LCM = 2³ × 3 × 5 = 120
