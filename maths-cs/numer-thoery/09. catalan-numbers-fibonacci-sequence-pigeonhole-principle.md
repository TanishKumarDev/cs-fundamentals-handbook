## **4. Examples / Solved Questions**

### **Example 1: Parentheses Expressions**

> How many valid expressions can be formed with 4 pairs of parentheses?

[

## **5. Practice Questions**

1. Find the **5th Catalan number** → `C5 = 42`
2. Number of distinct BSTs with 4 nodes → `C4 = 14`
3. Calculate the **3rd Catalan number** → `C3 = 5`
4. Number of valid parentheses expressions with 2 pairs → `C2 = 2`

---

### **6. Quick Intuition**

Catalan numbers **count the number of ways to arrange things recursively** without breaking rules:

* Parentheses stay balanced
* Trees are structurally unique
* Paths don’t cross forbidden boundaries

Think: **“How many valid structures can you make?”**

Here’s a **clear, structured, and concise guide** for the **Fibonacci Sequence**, organized for easy understanding and quick revision:

---

## **Fibonacci Sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where **each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers**.

**Sequence (starting with 0 and 1):**
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …

### **Mathematical Definition**

Recursive formula:

[
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \quad n > 1
]

**Base cases:**
[
F_0 = 0, \quad F_1 = 1
]

Optional starting variant: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, …

---

## **1. Example Terms**

| n | F(n) |
| - | ---- |
| 0 | 0    |
| 1 | 1    |
| 2 | 1    |
| 3 | 2    |
| 4 | 3    |
| 5 | 5    |
| 6 | 8    |
| 7 | 13   |
| 8 | 21   |
| 9 | 34   |

## **2. Fibonacci in Nature**

* **Sunflowers:** Number of spirals in the center often follows Fibonacci numbers.
* **Pinecones:** Spiral patterns match Fibonacci numbers.
* **Shells (Nautilus, Snails):** Growth follows a logarithmic spiral.
* **Galaxies:** Spiral galaxies often follow Fibonacci-like spirals.

---

## **3. Properties**

1. **Binet’s Formula** (Direct calculation for n-th term):

[
F_n = \frac{\Phi^n - (1-\Phi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}
]

Where (\Phi \approx 1.618) is the **Golden Ratio**.

2. **Ratio of consecutive terms** → Approaches **Golden Ratio**:

[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} \to \Phi \approx 1.618
]

3. **Negative Fibonacci numbers:**

[
F_{-n} = (-1)^{n+1} F_n
]

---

## **4. Applications in Computer Science & Math**

* **Dynamic Programming:** Climbing stairs problem (1 or 2 steps at a time).
* **Algorithm Analysis:** Recursive and iterative methods.
* **Mathematical Patterns:** Pascal’s Triangle, Lucas numbers.
* **Modeling Growth:** Rabbit reproduction problem (original Fibonacci problem).

---

## **5. Example Calculations**

1. **Recursive formula, 6th term (starting 0,1):**
   [
   F_6 = F_5 + F_4 = 5 + 3 = 8
   ]

2. **Golden Ratio check (7th and 8th term):**
   [
   F_7 = 13, F_8 = 21 \Rightarrow \frac{F_8}{F_7} = \frac{21}{13} \approx 1.615 \approx \Phi
   ]

3. **Negative Fibonacci (F-2):**
   [
   F_{-2} = (-1)^{2+1} F_2 = -1
   ]

---

## **6. Quick Intuition**

* **“Next = sum of previous two”** — simple but powerful.
* Fibonacci shows **recursive structure** in many natural and computational problems.
* Converges to **Golden Ratio**, connecting nature, math, and algorithms.

## **7. Practice Problems**

1. Find **F9**.
2. Calculate **F-4** using the negative Fibonacci formula.
3. Verify ratio of **F10 / F9** against Golden Ratio.
4. Count ways to climb **5 stairs** (1 or 2 steps at a time).

Here’s a **structured, concise, and easy-to-understand guide** on the **Pigeonhole Principle**, organized for quick revision and interview prep:

---

## **Pigeonhole Principle (PHP)**

### **1. Basic Idea**

If **n objects (pigeons)** are placed into **m containers (pigeonholes)** and **n > m**, then at least **one container contains more than one object**.

**Mathematically:**
[
n > m \implies \text{at least one pigeonhole contains ≥ 2 pigeons}
]

---

### **2. Simple Examples**

1. **Pigeons in holes:**
   13 pigeons, 12 holes → at least one hole has ≥ 2 pigeons.

2. **Socks problem:**
   10 black + 12 blue socks. How many must you pick to guarantee a matching pair?

* Colors = 2 → pick **3 socks** to ensure at least one pair.

---

### **3. Generalized Pigeonhole Principle**

If **n items** are placed into **k containers**, then at least **one container contains ≥ ⌈n/k⌉ items**.

**Example:**
100 students, 12 months → at least
[
\lceil 100/12 \rceil = 9
]
students share a birth month.

---

### **4. PHP Theorem (Average-based)**

Let (A = n/m) be the average number of pigeons per hole:

* At least one pigeonhole contains **≥ ⌈A⌉ pigeons**
* Remaining pigeonholes contain **≤ ⌊A⌋ pigeons**

**Example:**
(Kn+1) pigeons in n holes → at least one hole has ≥ K+1 pigeons.

---

### **5. Strong Form of PHP**

Let (q_1, q_2, ..., q_n) be positive integers. If
[
q_1 + q_2 + ... + q_n - n + 1 \text{ objects are placed in n boxes}
]
then **at least one box i contains ≥ q_i objects**.

**Example:**
Student club: 10 first-year, 8 second-year, 6 third-year, 4 final-year → min students to ensure a club:
[
10 + 8 + 6 + 4 - 4 + 1 = 25
]

---

### **6. Applications**

1. **Computer Science:** Hashing → collisions are guaranteed if keys > buckets.
2. **Coding Theory:** Error detection/correction.
3. **Number Theory:** Existence proofs (e.g., divisible differences).
4. **Graph Theory:** Subgraph existence or mutual friendship problems.

---

### **7. Solved Examples**

1. **52 integers → divisible difference by 51:**

* Consider remainders mod 51 → 51 possibilities, 52 numbers → two numbers share remainder → difference divisible by 51.

2. **1001 people → same number of friends:**

* 0–1000 possible friends → 1001 people → at least two with same number of friends.

3. **5 points in unit square → max distance ≤ 1/√2:**

* Divide square into 4 smaller squares → 5 points → at least 2 in same small square → max distance ≤ 1/√2.

4. **10 integers → two subsets with same sum:**

* 2¹⁰ = 1024 subsets, max sum ≤ 90 → by PHP, two subsets share sum.

---

### **8. Practice Questions**

| Problem                                                     | Solution     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 10 black + 10 blue socks → matching pair?                   | Pick 3 socks |
| Class of x students, scores 0–100 → min x for shared score? | x = 102      |
| City 500,000, max hairs 150,000 → same hair count?          | Yes, by PHP  |
| 6 people → ≥3 mutual friends/strangers?                     | By PHP, yes  |
| 3 types of shoes → min to get pair?                         | Pick 4 shoes |

---

### **9. Quick Intuition**

* If **objects > containers**, **collisions or repetitions are inevitable**.
* Useful in **proofs, combinatorics, and algorithm guarantees**.
* Strong form allows **different thresholds** for different containers.
