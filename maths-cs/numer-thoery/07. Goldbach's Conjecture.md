## **Goldbach’s Conjecture (Simplified Notes)**

### **Definition**

Goldbach’s Conjecture says:
➡️ Every **even number greater than 2** can be written as the **sum of two prime numbers**.

### **Mathematical Form**

For every even number **n ≥ 4**,
there exist primes **p** and **q** such that
**n = p + q**

---

### **Examples**

| Even Number (n) | Prime Pair (p, q) |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| 4               | 2 + 2             |
| 6               | 3 + 3             |
| 8               | 3 + 5             |
| 10              | 5 + 5 or 7 + 3    |
| 12              | 5 + 7             |

So, every even number seems to work!

### **Variants**

#### 1. **Strong (Binary) Goldbach’s Conjecture**

Every even number greater than 2 can be written as **sum of two primes**.
Example: 10 = 3 + 7

*(This is the famous unproven version.)*

#### 2. **Weak (Ternary) Goldbach’s Conjecture**

Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the **sum of three primes**.
✅ **Proved in 2013** by *Harald Helfgott*.

Example:

* 7 = 2 + 2 + 3
* 9 = 2 + 2 + 5
* 13 = 3 + 5 + 5

Alternative form:
Every odd n ≥ 7 can also be written as
**n = p + 2q** (where p, q are primes)
Example:

* 7 = 3 + 2×2
* 9 = 5 + 2×2
* 13 = 7 + 2×3

| Theorem / Result         | Year | Meaning                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vinogradov’s Theorem** | 1937 | Every large **odd** number = sum of **three** primes.                                 |
| **Chen’s Theorem**       | 1966 | Every large **even** number = sum of a **prime + semiprime (product of two primes)**. |
| **Computational Proofs** | 2012 | Verified for all even numbers up to **4×10¹⁸** — still not a full proof.              |

### **Why It’s Hard to Prove**

* We don’t have a **formula** that generates all primes.
* Prime numbers appear **unpredictably**.
* Existing mathematical tools (like sieve theory) can’t yet handle all cases.

### **In Short**

* The conjecture is **simple to state**, but **very hard to prove**.
* Verified for **huge numbers**, but **no general proof** yet.
* Still inspires **research**, **cryptography**, and **algorithm design**.
