## 1. Why Prime Numbers Are Important in Cryptography

👉 Cryptography = “Secure communication using math.”

To lock or unlock information, we use **keys** (numbers).
If someone can easily guess your key → your system is broken.
So we use **prime numbers** because:

* They have special mathematical properties.
* They are **hard to reverse** when combined in certain ways (like multiplication).

## 🔐 2. RSA Algorithm (Most Popular)

**RSA = uses two big prime numbers to lock data.**

---

### Step 1: Key Generation (Setup Phase)

1. Pick two large primes → `p` and `q`
   (example: 17 and 19, but in real life, they are 1000+ digits long)
2. Multiply them → `n = p × q`
   → `n` is shared with everyone.
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
   (used to find numbers that work well with n)
4. Pick a number `e` (public key part) → such that
   gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 (they don’t share any common factor)
5. Find another number `d` such that
   `(d × e) % φ(n) = 1` → (this is your **private key**)

So you have:

* Public key = (e, n)
* Private key = (d, n)

---

### Step 2: Encryption (Locking the message)

Formula → `C = (M^e) mod n`
You use **public key** to encrypt message `M` → get ciphertext `C`.

---

### Step 3: Decryption (Unlocking the message)

Formula → `M = (C^d) mod n`
You use **private key** to get back the original message.

---

### Tiny Example (to see it working)

```
p = 3, q = 11
n = 3 × 11 = 33
φ(n) = 20
e = 3  (since gcd(3,20)=1)
d = 7  (since 3×7 ≡ 1 mod 20)
```

Keys:

* Public = (3, 33)
* Private = (7, 33)

Message = 4
Encrypt → C = (4³ mod 33) = 31
Decrypt → M = (31⁷ mod 33) = 4 ✅

---

## 🔁 3. Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (Sharing Secret Key)

Goal → Two people (Alice & Bob) want to **agree on a secret key**,
even if someone is watching their conversation.

---

### Steps

1. Both agree publicly on a **prime number `p`** and a **base `g`**.
   (This is visible to everyone.)
2. Alice chooses secret number `a`, Bob chooses secret number `b`.
3. Alice computes → `A = gᵃ mod p`
   Bob computes → `B = gᵇ mod p`
4. They exchange A and B publicly.
5. Now:

   * Alice computes `S = Bᵃ mod p`
   * Bob computes `S = Aᵇ mod p`

👉 Both get **the same secret number S** (because of modular arithmetic).
This becomes their **shared secret key**.

---

### Why it’s secure:

Even if hacker sees p, g, A, B —
they **can’t find a or b easily**, because that means solving a **discrete logarithm problem**,
which is *extremely hard* for big primes.

## ⚙️ 4. Hard Math Problems Behind Security

| Problem                | Description                    | Used In        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Factorization**      | Given n = p × q → find p and q | RSA            |
| **Discrete Logarithm** | Given gˣ mod p → find x        | Diffie–Hellman |
| **Primality Testing**  | Check if a number is prime     | Key generation |

These are **hard** to solve for large numbers → so systems remain secure.

---

## 🔢 5. Why Big Primes Matter

* Small primes can be cracked easily.
* Modern cryptography uses **2048-bit or 4096-bit primes**.
* That’s like numbers with **hundreds of digits** — impossible to factor manually.
