# **Euclid’s Division Algorithm**

### **1. What is it?**

It’s a method to **find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** of two numbers — the biggest number that divides both.

---

### **2. The Basic Idea**

If you divide one number by another and get a remainder,
then the **GCD** of those two numbers is the same as the **GCD** of the divisor and the remainder.

In short:

* GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, r)
* where r is the remainder when a is divided by b

    * where
        * a = b × q + r
        * (Here, ( q ) is the quotient, ( r ) is the remainder)

---

### **3. Step-by-Step Method**

Let’s say we want to find GCD(a, b):

1. Divide ( a ) by ( b ):
   ( a = b × q + r )
2. If the remainder ( r ≠ 0 ), then:

   * Replace ( a ) with ( b )
   * Replace ( b ) with ( r )
   * Repeat the division
3. When the remainder becomes **0**, stop.
   The **last non-zero remainder** is your **GCD**.

### **4. Why it Works**

Each time you divide, the remainder keeps getting smaller.
So after a few steps, it must reach 0 — and that’s when you find the GCD.

### **5. Example 1**

Find GCD(252, 105):

1. ( 252 = 105 × 2 + 42 )
2. ( 105 = 42 × 2 + 21 )
3. ( 42 = 21 × 2 + 0 )

✅ **Last non-zero remainder = 21**
So, **GCD(252, 105) = 21**

---

### **6. Example 2**

Find GCD(360, 96):

1. ( 360 = 96 × 3 + 72 )
2. ( 96 = 72 × 1 + 24 )
3. ( 72 = 24 × 3 + 0 )

✅ **Last non-zero remainder = 24**
So, **GCD(360, 96) = 24**

---

### **7. Quick Practice**

| Numbers  | GCD |
| -------- | --- |
| 120, 45  | 15  |
| 144, 60  | 12  |
| 462, 192 | 6   |
| 84, 56   | 28  |

### **8. Bonus**

Relationship between **HCF** and **LCM**:
[
HCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b
]

| Concept         | Meaning                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Formula         | ( a = bq + r )                          |
| Remainder Range | ( 0 ≤ r < b )                           |
| GCD Rule        | ( GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, r)) |
| Stop When       | ( r = 0 )                               |
| Output          | Last non-zero remainder = GCD           |
