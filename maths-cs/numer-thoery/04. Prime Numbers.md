## **Prime Numbers**

### **1. Definition**

A **prime number** is a **natural number greater than 1** that has **exactly two factors** —
**1** and **itself**.

Examples:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...

If a number has **more than two factors**, it is called a **composite number**.

Example:
6 → factors are 1, 2, 3, 6 (so composite)

---

### **2. Important Notes**

* **1** is **not prime** and **not composite** (it has only one factor).
* **2** is the **smallest** and the **only even prime** number.
* **All other primes are odd**.

---

### **3. Prime Numbers from 1 to 100**

There are **25 prime numbers** between 1 and 100:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,
31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71,
73, 79, 83, 89, 97

### **4. Prime vs Composite**

| **Prime Numbers**                       | **Composite Numbers**          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Have only **two factors**: 1 and itself | Have **more than two factors** |
| Example: 5 → (1, 5)                     | Example: 6 → (1, 2, 3, 6)      |
| Almost all are **odd** (except 2)       | Can be **odd or even**         |

---

### **5. Smallest and Largest Prime**

* **Smallest prime:** 2
* **Largest prime:** Infinite — there is **no largest prime number**.
  (New larger primes are discovered using computers.)

---

### **6. Properties of Prime Numbers**

1. Every prime is a **natural number > 1**.
2. There are **infinitely many** prime numbers (proved by **Euclid**).
3. Every number greater than 1 can be **uniquely written as a product of primes** —
   this is called the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.

   Example:
   84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7

---

### **7. Co-prime Numbers**

Two numbers are **co-prime** if their **only common factor is 1**.

Example:
21 → factors: 1, 3, 7, 21
22 → factors: 1, 2, 11, 22
Common factor = 1 → So, **21 and 22 are co-prime**.

**Note:**
All prime numbers are **co-prime to each other**.

---

### **8. Interesting Facts**

* All primes (except 2) are odd.
* All primes (except 2 and 5) end with 1, 3, 7, or 9.
* Every number can be represented as a **product of primes**.
* The **sum of two primes** can represent an **even number** (related to **Goldbach’s conjecture**).

### **9. How to Find if a Number is Prime**

**Basic Rules:**

1. If a number ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 → **Not prime** (except 2).
2. Check divisibility by small primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.).
3. If divisible by any of them → **Not prime**.
4. If not → **Prime**.

**Efficient check:**
You only need to test divisibility **up to √n**.

### **10. Real-Life Applications**

Prime numbers are widely used in **Computer Science**, especially in:

* **Cryptography**
* **RSA Encryption**
* **Internet Security**
* **Digital Signatures**
* **Credit Card Transactions**

They ensure **data security** and **encryption strength**.

## *You only need to test divisibility up to √n ?*

### **1. What It Means**

When checking if a number `n` is prime,
you don’t need to divide it by **all numbers** up to `n – 1`.

You only need to check **up to the square root of n (√n)**.

---

### **2. Why This Works (Simple Logic)**

If a number `n` is **not prime**,
it can be written as a product of two smaller numbers:

```
n = a × b
```

Now —
If both `a` and `b` were **greater than √n**,
then their product would be **greater than n**, which is impossible.

So, at least **one of them must be ≤ √n**.

That means:

* If `n` has **any divisor**, one of them is **≤ √n**.
* If no number up to √n divides it, then **no larger number will either**.

### **3. Example 1: Check if 37 is Prime**

√37 ≈ 6.08
So we only check divisibility by:

```
2, 3, 4, 5, 6
```

None divide 37 →
✅ **37 is Prime**

We didn’t need to check 7, 8, 9, …, 36 — because if any of them divided 37,
there’d already be a smaller factor ≤ 6.

---

### **4. Example 2: Check if 49 is Prime**

√49 = 7
Check divisibility by numbers up to 7:

```
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```

49 ÷ 7 = 7 → divisible →
❌ **49 is not Prime**

---

### **5. Summary Table**

| Concept               | Meaning                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Formula               | n = a × b                      |
| Observation           | One of a or b ≤ √n             |
| So we check only till | √n                             |
| Benefit               | Faster prime check (less work) |

---

**In short:**
If a number has any divisor, the smaller one will always appear **before √n**,
so there’s no need to check beyond that.
