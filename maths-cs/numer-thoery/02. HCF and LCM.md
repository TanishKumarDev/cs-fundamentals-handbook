# HCF / GCD and LCM

## 1. Definitions

| Term    | Full Form               | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HCF** | Highest Common Factor   | Largest number that divides two or more numbers exactly (no remainder). |
| **GCD** | Greatest Common Divisor | Same as HCF — just a different name.                                    |
| **LCM** | Least Common Multiple   | Smallest number that is divisible by two or more numbers.               |

### Example

**Numbers:** 6 and 18

**Divisors of 6:** 1, 2, 3, 6
**Divisors of 18:** 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

→ **HCF = 6** (largest common divisor)

**Multiples of 6:** 6, 12, 18, 24, …
**Multiples of 18:** 18, 36, 54, …

→ **LCM = 18** (smallest common multiple)

## 2. Formula Connecting HCF and LCM

For two numbers `a` and `b`:

[
\text{LCM(a, b)} × \text{HCF(a, b)} = a × b
]

### Example:

For 15 and 70
Prime factors:
15 = 3 × 5
70 = 2 × 5 × 7

**HCF = 5**
**LCM = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 210**

Check:
[
15 × 70 = 1050
]
[
HCF × LCM = 5 × 210 = 1050
]

## 3. Methods to Find HCF and LCM

### A. Division Method (For HCF)

**Steps:**

1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
2. If the remainder = 0 → divisor is the HCF.
3. If remainder ≠ 0 → divide previous divisor by remainder.
4. Repeat until remainder = 0.

**Example:**
Find HCF(36, 48)

```
48 ÷ 36 = 1 remainder 12
36 ÷ 12 = 3 remainder 0
```

→ **HCF = 12**

---

### B. Division Method (For LCM)

**Steps:**

1. Divide the given numbers by common prime factors (2, 3, 5, …).
2. Continue until all quotients become 1.
3. Multiply all divisors used.

**Example:**
Find LCM(36, 48)

[
36 = 2^2 × 3^2 \
48 = 2^4 × 3
]

Take highest powers of each prime →
[
LCM = 2^4 × 3^2 = 144
]

### C. Prime Factorization Method (For HCF)

**Steps:**

1. Find prime factors of each number.
2. Multiply all **common** prime factors.

**Example:**
Find HCF(18, 90)
18 = 2 × 3 × 3
90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5
Common = 2 × 3 × 3
→ **HCF = 18**

---

### D. Prime Factorization Method (For LCM)

**Steps:**

1. Find prime factors of each number.
2. Take **maximum power** of each prime.
3. Multiply them.

**Example:**
18 = 2 × 3²
90 = 2 × 3² × 5
→ LCM = 2 × 3² × 5 = 90

## 4. Key Differences Between HCF and LCM

| Basis            | HCF (GCD)                              | LCM                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Meaning          | Largest common divisor                 | Smallest common multiple                     |
| Value Range      | ≤ smallest number                      | ≥ largest number                             |
| Used for         | Simplifying ratios, reducing fractions | Synchronizing cycles, finding common periods |
| Example (24, 36) | HCF = 12                               | LCM = 72                                     |

## 5. Practice-Based Intuition (Real-World Use)

| Scenario                                                    | Solution Type | Concept               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Cutting objects into equal pieces (e.g., ropes, tiles)      | HCF           | Maximum equal length  |
| Finding when events align again (like two clocks or cycles) | LCM           | Common time to repeat |

**Example:**
Two cyclists complete a round in 12 and 18 minutes.
They’ll meet again after **LCM(12,18) = 36 minutes**.

## 6. Coding Relevance (in C++ / Algorithms)

In programming and competitive coding, HCF and LCM are essential for:

* Fractions simplification
* Modular arithmetic
* Cryptographic key relations
* Number-theoretic algorithms (like RSA)

### Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

### LCM using GCD:

```cpp
int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b;
}
```
