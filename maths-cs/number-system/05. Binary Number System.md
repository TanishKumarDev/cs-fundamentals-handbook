## **1. What is Binary Number System?**

Binary means **base-2**, which uses **only two digits:**

```
Digits: 0 and 1
Base (radix): 2
```

Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2 (like in decimal, each position represents a power of 10).

For example:

```
(11001)₂ = 1×2⁴ + 1×2³ + 0×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰  
= 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = (25)₁₀
```

## ⚙️ **2. Conversion between Binary and Other Systems**

### Binary → Decimal

Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2 and sum them up.

Example:

```
(11101011)₂  
= 1×2⁷ + 1×2⁶ + 1×2⁵ + 0×2⁴ + 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰  
= 128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = (235)₁₀
```

---

### Binary → Octal

Group **3 bits from right to left**, convert each group to its octal equivalent.

Example:

```
(11101011)₂  
= (011 101 011)₂  
= (3 5 3)₈  
= (353)₈
```

---

### Binary → Hexadecimal

Group **4 bits from right to left**, convert each to hexadecimal (0–9, A–F).

Example:

```
(1110101101101)₂  
= 0001 1101 0110 1101  
= 1 D 6 D  
= (1D6D)₁₆
```

## **3. Arithmetic Operations in Binary**

| Operation | Rule      | Example |
| --------- | --------- | ------- |
| 0 + 0 = 0 | carry = 0 |         |
| 0 + 1 = 1 | carry = 0 |         |
| 1 + 0 = 1 | carry = 0 |         |
| 1 + 1 = 0 | carry = 1 |         |

### ✅ Example:

```
(1101)₂  
+ (1011)₂  
------------
(11000)₂  (in decimal → 24)
```

### Binary Subtraction Rules:

| A | B | Result | Borrow |
| - | - | ------ | ------ |
| 0 | 0 | 0      | 0      |
| 1 | 0 | 1      | 0      |
| 1 | 1 | 0      | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | 1      | 1      |

Example:

```
(1011)₂ - (0110)₂ = (0101)₂
```

---

### Binary Multiplication Rules:

| A | B | Result |
| - | - | ------ |
| 0 | 0 | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | 0      |
| 1 | 0 | 0      |
| 1 | 1 | 1      |

Example:

```
(101)₂ × (11)₂ = (1111)₂
```

---

###  Binary Division (like decimal division)

Example:

```
(11011)₂ ÷ (11)₂ = (1001)₂
```

---

## **4. Complements**

### 1’s Complement

Invert all bits (flip 0 → 1 and 1 → 0).

Example:

```
(10011)₂ → (01100)₂
```

### 2’s Complement

Take 1’s complement and add 1.

Example:

```
(1011)₂ → 1’s complement: (0100)₂  
Add 1 → (0101)₂
```

## **5. Why Binary is Important**

* All **computers** work in binary — logic gates, memory, processors.
* Used for **data storage, communication protocols**, and **digital circuits**.
* Essential for **low-level programming**, **networking**, and **data representation**.
