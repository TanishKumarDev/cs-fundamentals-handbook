## **Why Are There Different Number Systems?**

Mathematics is the base of computer science,
and number systems are how we represent and handle numbers — both for humans and computers.

### 1. Binary System (Base 2)

* Digits used: 0 and 1
* Used by: Computers (hardware)
* Why:
  Computers only understand electric signals —

  * ON = 1
  * OFF = 0
    So everything inside a computer is stored and processed in binary.

Example:
Binary 101 = Decimal 5
(Binary to Decimal → 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 5)

### 2. Decimal System (Base 10)

* Digits used: 0–9
* Used by: Humans
* Why:
  It's our natural counting system (10 fingers).
  Computers can't directly use it, but it's how we input and understand numbers.

Example:
You enter 123 → computer converts it internally to binary to process it.

### 3. Octal System (Base 8)

* Digits used: 0–7
* Used by: Older computers & Unix systems
* Why:
  Easier way to shorten binary numbers —
  each octal digit = 3 binary bits.

Example:
Binary 101011 = Octal 53

Used in UNIX file permissions, like chmod 755.

### 4. Hexadecimal System (Base 16)

* Digits used: 0–9 and A–F
  (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15)
* Used by: Programmers
* Why:
  Easier way to represent large binary numbers.
  Each hex digit = 4 binary bits.

Examples:

* Binary 1111 = Hex F
* Memory address: 0x1A3F
* HTML color: #FFFFFF (White)

### Quick Summary Table

| Number System   | Base | Used By       | Main Use Case                  |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Binary          | 2    | Hardware      | Computer's internal language   |
| Decimal        | 10   | Humans        | Input/output                   |
| Octal         | 8    | Old computers | Simplify binary (Unix)         |
| Hexadecimal     | 16   | Programmers   | Memory, colors, compact binary |

### Simple Analogy

Think of it like languages:

* Humans speak Decimal
* Computers speak Binary
* Programmers use Hexadecimal to talk to both — like a translator!
