## **What is a Number System?**

A **Number System** is a **way to represent numbers** using a fixed set of symbols (called digits) and **rules**.

Every computer stores all types of data — **text, images, audio, video, code, memory** — as numbers.
Ultimately, **everything inside a computer = binary (0s and 1s).**

## Why Different Number Systems?

* Humans understand numbers in **decimal (0–9)** form.
* Computers understand only **binary (0 and 1)** form.
* But **binary can get very long**, so we use **octal (base 8)** and **hexadecimal (base 16)** to make it shorter and readable.

> **In short:**
> Decimal → For humans
> Binary → For computers
> Octal & Hexadecimal → For programmers (compact & readable)

## Key Concept: Base (or Radix)

Each number system has a **base**, which tells how many **unique digits** it uses.

| Number System | Base | Digits Used |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Decimal       | 10   | 0–9         |
| Binary        | 2    | 0, 1        |
| Octal         | 8    | 0–7         |
| Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0–9, A–F    |

## 1. Decimal Number System (Base 10)

The number system humans normally use.

* Digits: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`
* Each position (place value) = power of 10
  (Right to left: 10⁰, 10¹, 10², 10³…)
