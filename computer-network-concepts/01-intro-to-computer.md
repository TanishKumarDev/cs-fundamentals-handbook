# COMPUTER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS

## Introduction to Computers and Their Roles


## 1. What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an electronic device that:

* Takes input (data),
* Processes it using a CPU,
* Stores it in memory or storage, and
* Produces output (results).

It works according to a set of **instructions (software)** and performs tasks such as calculation, storage, and communication.

## 2. Hardware and Software

### Hardware

The **physical components** of a computer that you can see or touch.
Examples:

* **CPU** (Central Processing Unit)
* **RAM** (Memory)
* **Storage Devices** (HDD, SSD)
* **Input Devices** (Keyboard, Mouse)
* **Output Devices** (Monitor, Printer)

### Software

A **set of instructions or programs** that tell the computer how to perform tasks.
It interacts with hardware to perform operations.

**Types of Software:**

1. **System Software** – e.g., Operating System (Windows, Linux)
2. **Application Software** – e.g., MS Word, Web Browser
3. **Utility Software** – e.g., Antivirus, Disk Management tools

**Working Example:**

1. You press the letter “A” on the keyboard.
2. The **hardware (keyboard)** sends a signal to the computer.
3. The **software** interprets it and tells the CPU what to do.
4. The **CPU** processes it and sends output to the **monitor**.
