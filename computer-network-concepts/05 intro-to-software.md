# 📘 Day 5: Software Overview

**Module:** Computer Fundamentals
**Topic:** Software and its Types

---

## 🧠 1. What is Software?

* **Definition:** Software is a set of **instructions** that tell a computer **how to perform specific tasks**.
* It is **non-physical**, unlike hardware.
* Acts as a **bridge between user and hardware**, making the hardware perform desired operations.

**🧩 Examples:**
MS Word, MS Excel, PowerPoint, Web Browser, Photoshop, etc.

---

## 🧭 2. Types of Software

There are **two main types** of software:

```
Software
│
├── System Software
│    ├── Operating System
│    ├── Language Processor
│    └── Device Driver
│
└── Application Software
     ├── General Purpose Software
     ├── Customized Software
     └── Utility Software
```

## ⚙️ 3. System Software

**Definition:**
Software that **controls computer hardware** and provides a **platform for application software** to run.

### 🧩 Examples:

Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), Language Translators, Device Drivers, Utilities.

### 🔍 Role:

* Acts as an **interface** between **hardware and user applications**.
* Converts user commands (high-level) → machine instructions (binary).

---

### 🔸 Types of System Software

#### 1️⃣ **Operating System (OS)**

* Main program of a computer system.
* Loads first when the computer starts.
* Manages **CPU, memory, devices**, and provides **user interface**.
* Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android.

**🔧 Key Functions:**

* Resource Management
* Process Management
* Memory Management
* File Management
* Security & Scheduling

---

#### 2️⃣ **Language Processor**

Converts human-readable programs → machine-readable form.

**Types:**

| Translator      | Function                                  | Example      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Assembler**   | Converts assembly language → machine code | MASM         |
| **Compiler**    | Converts entire program → machine code    | gcc, javac   |
| **Interpreter** | Executes line-by-line                     | Python, Ruby |

---

#### 3️⃣ **Device Driver**

* Software that helps the OS **communicate with hardware devices** (printer, mouse, etc.).
* Every hardware requires a driver to function properly.

🧠 **Example:** Installing a printer driver before using a printer.

---

#### 4️⃣ **Firmware**

* **Low-level software** embedded in hardware components (e.g., BIOS, UEFI).
* Controls basic hardware operations before OS loads.

---

#### 5️⃣ **Utility Software**

* Helps **maintain, configure, optimize, or protect** the computer.
* Examples:

  * Antivirus
  * Disk Cleanup
  * Backup Tools
  * Compression Tools (WinRAR, WinZip)
  * Disk Defragmenter
