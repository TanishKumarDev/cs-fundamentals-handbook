# C++ File Handling: Deleting a File

## Overview

* **Objective:** Remove a file from the file system using a C++ program.
* **Function Used:** `remove()` from `<cstdio>` (or `<stdio.h>`).

---

## Syntax

```cpp
int remove(const char* path);
```

* `path` → Relative or absolute path to the file.
* Returns **0** → File deleted successfully.
* Returns **non-zero** → Error occurred.

---

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <cstdio>   // For remove()
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Remove the file named "myfile.txt"
    int status = remove("myfile.txt");

    // Check if the file has been successfully removed
    if (status != 0) {
        perror("Error deleting file");
    } else {
        cout << "File successfully deleted" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

## Output

```
File successfully deleted
```

---

## Notes

1. `remove()` **cannot delete directories**. Use `rmdir()` for directories.
2. Ensure the file is **not open** in any program when deleting.
3. **Time Complexity:** O(1) – constant time operation.
4. **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
