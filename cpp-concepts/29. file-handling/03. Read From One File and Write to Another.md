# C++: Read From One File and Write to Another

## Overview

* **Objective:** Read the contents of one file and write them into another file.
* **Files Used:**

  * `file1.txt` – source file
  * `file2.txt` – destination file

---

## Approach

1. Create an **input file stream** (`ifstream`) to open the source file.
2. Create an **output file stream** (`ofstream`) to open the destination file.
3. Read the file line by line using `getline()`.
4. Write each line to the destination file.
5. Close both files (optional, done automatically when stream goes out of scope).

---

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Input file stream object to read from file1.txt
    ifstream in("file1.txt");

    // Output file stream object to write to file2.txt
    ofstream out("file2.txt");

    // Reading file until end-of-file
    while (!in.eof()) {
        string text;
        getline(in, text);  // Extract line from file1.txt
        out << text << endl; // Write the line to file2.txt
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

* `ifstream` → used for reading files.
* `ofstream` → used for writing files.
* Using `while(!in.eof())` works but is **not recommended**; a better approach is:

```cpp
while (getline(in, text)) {
    out << text << endl;
}
```

* This avoids writing an **extra empty line** at the end if the file ends with a newline.
* File streams automatically **close** when their objects go out of scope.
