## Introduction to C++ Programming Language

### Overview of C++
- **Definition**: C++ is a general-purpose, middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs, initially as an enhancement of the C language called "C with Classes."
- **Purpose**: Combines high-level and low-level language features to support both user-friendly programming and direct hardware interaction.
- **Renaming**: Renamed to C++ in 1983, where "++" signifies an increment over C, reflecting its improvements.

### Characteristics of C++
- **Middle-Level Language**:
  - **High-Level Features**: Supports object-oriented programming (OOP), exception handling, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL), making it user-friendly like Python or Java.
  - **Low-Level Features**: Allows direct memory manipulation (e.g., pointers, manual memory management with `new` and `delete`) and system-level programming, similar to C or Assembly.
- **Compiled Language**:
  - Uses a compiler to translate the entire source code into machine code (binary), generating an executable file (e.g., `.exe` on Windows).
  - Unlike interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), C++ compiles the full program before execution, resulting in faster runtime performance.

### Key Features of C++
- **Simple**: Programs can be broken into logical units (functions, classes) with rich library support and diverse data types.
- **Machine Independent**: Code runs on any machine with a suitable compiler.
- **Low-Level Access**: Enables direct control over system resources and memory, ideal for system programming.
- **Fast Execution**: No interpreter overhead, making it one of the fastest high-level languages.
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports classes, inheritance, and polymorphism for reusable and organized code.

### Applications of C++
- **Operating Systems**: Used in Windows, parts of Linux, and macOS.
- **Game Engines**: Core component of Unreal Engine and Unity.
- **Web Browsers**: Powers Chrome and Firefox.
- **Compilers**: Used in GCC and LLVM.
- **Embedded Systems**: Applied in IoT devices, automotive systems, and robotics.
- **Finance**: Critical for high-frequency trading software due to its speed.

### History of C++
- **1979**: Bjarne Stroustrup created "C with Classes" at Bell Labs.
- **1983**: Renamed to C++.
- **Standardized Versions**:
  - **C++98**: First standard.
  - **C++11**: Introduced `auto`, lambdas, and smart pointers.
  - **C++17**: Added modern features for usability.
  - **C++20**: Included concepts, ranges, and coroutines.
  - **C++23**: Latest standard with safer, cleaner code features.

### Why Learn C++?
- **Versatility**: Used in operating systems, embedded systems, GUIs, and high-frequency trading.
- **Dual Capabilities**: Combines low-level (manual memory management) and high-level (OOP) features.
- **Syntax Similarity**: Shares syntax with C, Java, and C#, easing transitions between languages.
- **Performance**: Offers fast execution, critical for competitive programming and high-performance applications.

## Understanding the First C++ Program

### Example: Hello World Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
- **Output**: `Hello World!`

### Program Components
- **Preprocessor Directives**:
  - `#include <iostream>`: Imports the input-output library for functions like `cout`.
- **Header Files**:
  - Contain functions, variables, and macros for reuse (e.g., `<iostream>`, `<string.h>`).
  - Modern C++ header files may omit the `.h` extension.
- **Namespace**:
  - `using namespace std;`: Imports the `std` namespace to use standard library features (e.g., `std::cout`) without prefixing.
  - Prevents name conflicts by grouping related entities.
- **Main Function**:
  - `int main()`: Entry point of the program where execution begins.
  - `{}`: Braces denote the start and end of the `main` function.
- **Output Statement**:
  - `cout << "Hello World!";`: Prints text to the console, with `<<` as the output operator.
  - Semicolon (`;`) marks the end of a statement.
- **Return Statement**:
  - `return 0;`: Signals successful program completion.
- **Comments**:
  - Used for documentation (e.g., `// C++ program to print "Hello World"`).
  - Ignored by the compiler, improving code readability.
- **Indentation**:
  - Enhances readability by aligning code blocks (e.g., indenting `cout` and `return`).

### Program Execution Process
1. **Write Source Code**:
   - Code is written in a `.cpp` file (e.g., `program.cpp`), which is human-readable.
2. **Compilation**:
   - A compiler (e.g., GCC) translates the entire source code into machine code, producing an executable file (e.g., `.exe` on Windows).
3. **Linking**:
   - Links the program with libraries (e.g., `<iostream>`) to include necessary functions like `cout`.
4. **Execution**:
   - The executable runs directly on the CPU without needing the compiler again.

### Compiler vs. Interpreter
- **Compiler (C++)**:
  - Processes the entire program at once.
  - Generates a standalone executable.
  - Fast execution (e.g., C++, C, Rust, Go).
- **Interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript)**:
  - Executes code line by line at runtime.
  - No standalone executable, slower due to interpreter overhead.

## Setting Up a C++ Development Environment

### Option 1: Using Online IDEs
- **Definition**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software for coding, compiling, and running programs.
- **Advantages**: No local setup required; accessible via browsers.
- **Example Program**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Learning C++ at GeekforGeeks";
    return 0;
}
```
- **Output**: `Learning C++ at GeekforGeeks`
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(1)
- **Usage**: Click "Run on IDE" to execute code online.

### Option 2: Setting Up a Local Environment
#### Components
1. **C++ Compiler**:
   - Converts high-level C++ code into machine code.
   - Example: GNU GCC for Linux, MinGW for Windows/Mac.
2. **Text Editor**:
   - Used to write and edit `.cpp` files (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks).
   - Files must have `.cpp` or `.c` extensions to indicate C++ source code.

#### Installing GNU GCC on Linux
1. **Update Package List**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. **Install GCC and G++**:

   ```
4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   g++ --version
   ```
5. **Write and Save Program**:
   - Create a `.cpp` file (e.g., `helloworld.cpp`) with C++ code.
6. **Compile Program**:
   ```bash
   g++ helloworld.cpp -o hello
   ```
   - `helloworld.cpp`: Source file.
   - `hello`: Name of the generated executable.
7. **Run Program**:
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```
