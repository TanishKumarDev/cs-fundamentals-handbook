# **Static Members and Static Functions in Classes (C++)**

---

## **1. What is a Static Member?**

A **static member** of a class is **shared among all objects of the class**, rather than each object having its own copy.

### **Purpose**

* To **share a value** across all objects.
* To **maintain common data** without duplicating it for every object.
* Commonly used for **counters**, **constants**, or **configuration** data shared by all objects.

---

## **2. Syntax of Static Members**

```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    static int counter; // static data member
};
```

### **Key Points**

* Declared using the keyword `static`.
* **Only one copy exists**, shared by all objects.
* Must be **defined outside the class** (except `const` integral types).

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
public:
    string name;
    static int count; // static member

    Employee(string n) {
        name = n;
        count++;       // increment static counter
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Employee: " << name << endl;
    }
};

// Definition of static member outside class
int Employee::count = 0;

int main() {
    Employee e1("Tanish");
    Employee e2("Rohit");
    Employee e3("Anita");

    cout << "Total employees created: " << Employee::count << endl;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Total employees created: 3
```

---

## **3. Static Member Functions**

A **static member function**:

* Can **access only static members**.
* Can be called **without an object**.
* Declared using `static` keyword.

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    static int count;

    static void showCount() {  // static function
        cout << "Total Employees: " << count << endl;
    }
};

int Employee::count = 0;

int main() {
    Employee::count = 5;        // access static member directly
    Employee::showCount();      // call static function
}
```

**Output:**

```
Total Employees: 5
```

## **4. Differences Between Static and Non-Static Members**

| Feature                  | Non-Static Members           | Static Members / Functions              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Copy per object          | Each object has its own copy | Only **one shared copy** across objects |
| Access                   | Using object                 | Using class name or object              |
| Memory Allocation        | Created with object          | Created only once in class scope        |
| Access to `this` pointer | Yes                          | No (`this` pointer unavailable)         |
| Use-case                 | Object-specific data         | Data shared among all objects           |

---

## **5. Static Members With Objects**

* **Static members exist even if no objects are created.**
* Non-static members exist **only when an object is created**.

Example:

```cpp
class Counter {
public:
    static int totalCount;

    Counter() {
        totalCount++;
    }
};

int Counter::totalCount = 0;

int main() {
    cout << "Before creating objects: " << Counter::totalCount << endl;

    Counter c1;
    Counter c2;

    cout << "After creating objects: " << Counter::totalCount << endl;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Before creating objects: 0
After creating objects: 2
```

---

## **6. Why Use Static Members?**

* To **count objects created** (like a serial number generator).
* To **store constants or shared values** across all objects.
* To **avoid redundancy** of data for each object.
* To implement **utility functions** inside a class that donâ€™t depend on object data.

---

## **7. Example: Employee ID Generator**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
private:
    string name;
    int id;
    static int nextId;  // shared counter

public:
    Employee(string n) {
        name = n;
        id = nextId++;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Employee ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

// initialize static member
int Employee::nextId = 1;

int main() {
    Employee e1("Tanish");
    Employee e2("Rohit");
    Employee e3("Anita");

    e1.display();
    e2.display();
    e3.display();
}
```

**Output:**

```
Employee ID: 1, Name: Tanish
Employee ID: 2, Name: Rohit
Employee ID: 3, Name: Anita
```

* **Note:** All objects share `nextId`. Each new object increments it automatically.

---

## **8. Key Takeaways**

* **Static Members:** Shared across all objects of a class.
* **Static Functions:** Can access **only static members**, no `this` pointer.
* **Use Cases:** Counters, shared configuration, utility functions.
* Must **define static data members outside class** (except `const` integral types).
