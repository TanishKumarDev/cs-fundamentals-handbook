# C++ Static Member Functions

## Definition

* A **static member function** belongs to the **class itself**, not to any specific object.
* Declared using the `static` keyword inside the class.
* Can **only access static data members** or other static functions.
* Useful when function logic is **independent of object state**.

---

## Syntax

**Declaration inside class:**

```cpp
class GFG {
public:
    static void display();  // Declaration
};
```

**Definition outside class:**

```cpp
void GFG::display() {
    // Function body
}
```

> Just like static data members, static functions exist **independently of any object instance**.

---

## Key Points

* Can be called **without creating an object**.
* Access **only static data members or other static functions**.
* Commonly used for:

  * Utility/helper functions
  * Design patterns (Singleton, Factory)
  * Managing shared data across all objects (e.g., object counters)

## Example: Working of Static Member Functions

```cpp
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std; 

class Box  
{  
private:  
    static int length; 
    static int breadth;  
    static int height;  
    
public:
    static void print()  
    {  
        cout << "The value of length: " << length << endl;  
        cout << "The value of breadth: " << breadth << endl;  
        cout << "The value of height: " << height << endl;  
    }
};  

// Initialize static data members outside the class
int Box::length = 10;  
int Box::breadth = 20;  
int Box::height = 30;  

int main()  
{
    Box b;  

    cout << "Called through object:" << endl;  
    b.print();  
    
    cout << "\nCalled through class name:" << endl;  
    Box::print();  
    
    return 0;  
}
```

**Output:**

```
Called through object:
The value of length: 10
The value of breadth: 20
The value of height: 30

Called through class name:
The value of length: 10
The value of breadth: 20
The value of height: 30
```

## Notes

1. **Accessing private static members** from outside the class is allowed **only through the class scope resolution operator** (`ClassName::member`) during initialization.
2. Static member functions **cannot access non-static members**.
3. Recommended to call static functions using the **class name**, not through objects.
