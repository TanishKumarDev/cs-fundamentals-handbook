# C++ Static Data Members

## Definition

* **Static data members** are class members declared using the `static` keyword.
* **Only one copy** exists for the entire class, shared by all objects.
* Initialized **before any object** of the class is created.
* Lifetime: **entire program**.
* Access can be controlled by class **access specifiers**.

---

## Syntax

```cpp
class ClassName {
    static data_type data_member_name;
};
```

> Static members are **useful for maintaining shared data** across all instances of a class.

---

## Example 1: Basic Static Member

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    static int x; // Declaration
    A() { cout << "A's constructor called" << endl; }
};

// Definition outside the class
int A::x = 2;

int main() {
    cout << "Accessing static data member: " << A::x << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Accessing static data member: 2
```

---

## Rules for Definition

* Static members **cannot be initialized inside the class** (except `static const` integral types).
* Must be defined **outside the class**:

```cpp
datatype ClassName::member_name = value;
```

### **C++17 Inline Static Members**

```cpp
class A {
    static inline int x = 10; // inline definition inside class
};
```

---

## Accessing Static Members

1. **Using Class Name and Scope Resolution Operator**

```cpp
ClassName::member_name
```

2. **Through Objects**

```cpp
object.member_name
```

> Access can be controlled using `public`, `protected`, or `private`.

---

## Example 2: Verifying Properties

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class stMember {
public:
    int val;
    stMember(int v = 10): val(v) { cout << "Static Object Created" << endl; }
};

class A {
public:
    static stMember s;
    A() { cout << "A's Constructor Called" << endl; }
};

stMember A::s = stMember(11);

int main() {
    cout << "Accessing static member without object: " << A::s.val << endl;

    A obj1; // constructor called
    A obj2; // constructor called

    cout << "obj1.s.val: " << obj1.s.val << endl;
    cout << "obj2.s.val: " << obj2.s.val << endl;
    cout << "A::s.val: " << A::s.val << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Static Object Created
Accessing static member without object: 11
Creating object now: A's Constructor Called
Creating object now: A's Constructor Called
obj1.s.val: 11
obj2.s.val: 11
A::s.val: 11
```

**Key Points:**

* **Static member is shared** among all objects.
* **Only one copy** exists regardless of number of objects.
* Can be accessed **without creating an object**.
